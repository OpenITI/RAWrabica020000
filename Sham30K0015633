# والخفية sincerity and significance of intentions and all actions,
~~apparent and hidden PageV01P0002
# بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم قال الله تعالى ( البينة 5 ) : { وما أمروا إلا
~~ليعبدوا الله مخلصين له الدين حنفاء ويقيموا الصلاة ويؤتوا الزكاة وذلك دين
~~القيمة } allah, the exalted, says: "and they were commanded not, but
~~that they should worship allah, and worship none but him alone
~~(abstaining from ascribing partners to him), and perform as-salat
~~(iqamat-as-salat) and give zakat, and that is the right religion.''
~~(98:5 وقال تعالى ( الحج 37 ) : { لن ينال الله لحومها ولا دماؤها ولكن
~~يناله التقوى منكم } "it is neither their meat nor their blood that
~~reaches allah, but it is piety from you that reaches him.'' (22:37) وقال
~~تعالى ( آل عمران 29 ) : { قل إن تخفوا ما في صدوركم أو تبدوه يعلمه الله }
~~"say (o muhammad (pbuh) ): whether you hide what is in your breasts or
~~reveal it, allah knows it". (3:29) PageV01P0003

# وعن أمير المؤمنين أبي حفص عمر بن الخطاب بن نفيل بن عبد العزى بن رياح
~~بن عبد الله بن قرط بن رزاح بن عدي بن كعب بن لؤي بن غالب القرشي العدوي
~~رضي الله عنه قال سمعت رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم يقول : [ إنما
~~الأعمال بالنيات وإنما لكل امرئ ما نوى . فمن كانت هجرته إلى الله ورسوله
~~فهجرته إلى الله ورسوله ومن كانت هجرته لدنيا يصيبها أو امرأة ينكحها
~~فهجرته إلى ما هاجر إليه ] متفق على صحته . رواه إماما المحدثين : أبو عبد
~~الله محمد بن إسماعيل بن إبراهيم بن المغيرة بن بردزبه الجعفي البخاري وأبو
~~الحسين مسلم بن الحجاج بن مسلم القشيري النيسابوري رضي الله عنهما في
~~كتابيهما اللذين هما أصح الكتب المصنفة. 1. narrated 'umar bin al-khattab
~~(may allah be pleased with him), reported: messenger of allah (pbuh)
~~said, "the deeds are considered by the intentions, and a person will get
~~the reward according to his intention. so whoever emigrated for allah
~~and his messenger, his emigration will be for allah and his messenger;
~~and whoever emigrated for worldly benefits or for a woman to marry, his
~~emigration would be for what he emigrated for". [al-bukhari and muslim].
~~commentary: according to some ahadith, the reason for this hadith is
~~that a person sent a proposal of marriage to a woman named umm qais,
~~which she turned down saying that he should have to emigrate to al-
~~madinah for it. accordingly, he did it for this specific purpose, and
~~the two were married there. on account of this event, the man came to be
~~known among the companions as muhajir umm qais. on the basis of this
~~hadith, 'ulama' are of the unanimous opinion that the real basis of
~~one's actions is niyyah (intention) and everyone will be requited
~~according to his niyyah. it is true that niyyah is founded in one's
~~heart, that is to say, one has first to make up one's mind for what he
~~intends to do and he should not express it verbally. in fact, the latter
~~is a bid`ah (innovation in religion) because no proof of it is found in
~~shariah. the point which becomes evident from this hadith is that ikhlas
~~(sincerity) is a must for every action. in other words, in every
~~righteous deed, one should seek only the pleasure of allah; otherwise,
~~it will not be accepted by allah. PageV01P0004

# وعن أم المؤمنين أم عبد الله عائشة رضي الله عنها قالت قال رسول الله
~~صلى الله عليه و سلم : [ يغزو جيش الكعبة فإذا كانوا ببيداء من الأرض يخسف
~~بأولهم وآخرهم ] قالت قلت : يا رسول الله كيف يخسف بأولهم وآخرهم وفيهم
~~أسواقهم ومن ليس منهم ؟ قال : [ يخسف بأولهم وآخرهم ثم يبعثون على نياتهم ]
~~متفق عليه . هذا لفظ البخاري. 2. 1-2- narrated 'a`ishah (may allah be
~~pleased with her) reported: messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "an army
~~will raid the ka`bah and when it reaches a desert land, all of them will
~~be swallowed up by the earth.'' she asked; "o messenger of allah! why
~~all of them?'' he answered, "all of them will be swallowed by the earth
~~but they will be raised for judgement according to their intentions.''
~~[al-bukhari and muslim]. commentary: everyone will be rewarded or
~~punished according to his aim and intention. this hadith also proves
~~that the company of depraved persons is extremely dangerous. whose army
~~would it be, which has been referred to in the hadith, and when will it
~~invade ka`bah, is a matter known to allah alone. such prophecies are a
~~part of the unseen world. since they come in the category of the
~~miracles of the prophet (pbuh), it is necessary to believe in their
~~veracity and occurrence. believing in such prophesies is also essential
~~because they were revealed by allah). PageV01P0005

# وعن عائشة رضي الله عنها قالت قال النبي صلى الله عليه و سلم : [ لا
~~هجرة بعد الفتح ولكن جهاد ونية وإذا استنفرتم فانفروا ] متفق عليه ومعناه :
~~لا هجرة من مكة لأنها صارت دار إسلام. 3- a`ishah (may allah be pleased
~~with her) narrated that the prophet (pbuh) said, "there is no emigration
~~after the conquest (of makkah) but only jihad [(striving and fighting in
~~the cause of allah) will continue] and good intention.* so if you are
~~summoned to fight, go forth.'' [al-bukhari and muslim]. *. intention
~~according to an-nawawi: it means that goodness which ceased to continue
~~by the cessation of emigration can still be obtained by jihad and by
~~intending accomplishing good deeds. commentary. when a country or a
~~region is regarded as dar-ul-islam (land of islam), it is not necessary
~~to migrate from it to some other place. it is, however, obligatory to
~~emigrate from such regions which are dar-ul-kufr (land of infidels) and
~~where it is difficult to adhere to islamic injunctions. it is also
~~evident from this hadith that when it is not necessary to migrate from
~~one islamic country to another then it is also not permitted by the
~~shari`ah to leave an islamic country to settle permanently in dar-ul-
~~kufr only for the reason that the latter has plenty of wealth and social
~~welfare. unfortunately, muslims today are afflicted with this disease.
~~the transfer of their capital and talent to dar-ul-kufr is indeed very
~~disturbing because on one side these two factors are lending support to
~~the economy of bilad-ul-kufr (countries of infidels) and on the other,
~~obscenity and indecency that are common in such countries, are becoming
~~increasingly common among the muslims too. another highly important
~~reason for the prohibition of migration of muslims to dar-ul-kufr is
~~that it goes against the spirit as well as their readiness for jihad fi
~~sabilillah (striving and fighting in the way of allah). this spirit and
~~readiness must be kept always alive so that the muslims may respond at
~~once to the call of jihad whenever the need for it arises anywhere.

# وعن أبي عبد الله جابر بن عبد الله الأنصاري رضي الله عنهما قال : كنا
~~مع النبي صلى الله عليه و سلم في غزاة فقال : [ إن بالمدينة لرجالا ما سرتم
~~مسيرا ولا قطعتم واديا إلا كانوا معكم حبسهم المرض] وفي رواية : إلا شركوكم
~~في الأجر ] رواه مسلم ورواه البخاري عن أنس قال : [ رجعنا من غزوة تبوك مع
~~النبي صلى الله عليه و سلم فقال : [ إن أقواما خلفنا بالمدينة ما سلكنا
~~شعبا ولا واديا ألا وهم معنا حبسهم العذر ]. 4. 4- jabir bin abdullah al-
~~ansari (may allah be pleased with them) reported: we accompanied the
~~prophet (pbuh) in an expedition when he said, "there are some men in al-
~~madinah who are with you wherever you march and whichever valley you
~~cross. they have not joined you in person because of their illness.'' in
~~another version he said: "they share the reward with you.'' [muslim]. it
~~is narrated by bukhari from anas bin malik (may allah be pleased with
~~him): we were coming back from the battle of tabuk with the prophet
~~(pbuh) when he remarked, "there are people whom we left behind in al-
~~madinah who accompanied us in spirit in every pass and valley we
~~crossed. they remained behind for a valid excuse.'' commentary: what we
~~learn from this hadith is that if the intention and spirit of jihad are
~~present in the heart of a muslim but physically he is unable to take
~~part in it for valid reasons, he will get the reward of jihad without
~~even his actual participation in it. PageV01P0007

# وعن أبي يزيد معن بن يزيد بن الأخنس رضي الله عنهم وهو وأبوه وجده
~~صحابيون قال : كان أبي يزيد أخرج دنانير يتصدق بها فوضعها عند رجل في
~~المسجد فجئت فأخذتها فأتيته بها فقال : والله ما إياك أردت فخاصمته إلى
~~رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم فقال : [ لك ما نويت يا يزيد ولك ما أخذت يا
~~معن ] رواه البخاري. 5- ma`n bin yazid bin akhnas (may allah be pleased
~~with them) (he, his father and his grandfather, all were companions)
~~reported: my father set aside some dinars for charity and gave them to a
~~man in the mosque. i went to that man and took back those dinars. he
~~said: "i had not intended you to be given.'' so we went to messenger of
~~allah (pbuh), and put forth the matter before him. he said to my father,
~~"yazid, you have been rewarded for what you intended.'' and he said to
~~me, "ma`n, you are entitled to what you have taken.'' [al-bukhari].
~~commentary: 1- this hadith leads us to the conclusion that if sadaqah
~~(charity), goes to a needy son of a muslim, there is no need to take it
~~back from him for the reason that the father had intended to give it to
~~a deserving person. the former gets the reward for it on account of his
~~niyyah (intention). this however, will be reckoned as nafli sadaqah
~~(voluntary charity) because the obligatory zakat (sadaqah) cannot be
~~given to the donor's own dependents. 2- it is permissible in shari`ah to
~~make someone a wakil (attorney or agent) for sadaqah. 3- it does not
~~amount to disobedience on the part of a son to take his father to a
~~competent authority or scholar to know the legal position on any issue,
~~in the same way, as mutual discussion and debate on matters of shari`ah
~~does not amount to insolence. (fath al-bari, chapter on zakat). .

# وعن أبي إسحاق سعد بن أبي وقاص مالك بن أهيب بن عبد مناف بن زهرة بن
~~كلاب بن مرة بن كعب بن لؤي القرشي الزهري رضي الله عنه أحد العشرة المشهود
~~لهم بالجنة رضي الله عنهم قال : جاءني رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم
~~يعودني عام حجة الوداع من وجع اشتد بي فقلت : يا رسول الله إني قد بلغ بي
~~من الوجع ما ترى وأنا ذو مال ولا يرثني إلا ابنة لي أفأتصدق بثلثي مالي ؟
~~قال [ لا ] قلت : فالشطر يا رسول الله ؟ فقال [ لا ] قال : فالثلث يا رسول
~~الله ؟ قال : [ الثلث والثلث كثير أو كبير إنك أن تذر ورثتك أغنياء خير من
~~أن تذرهم عالة يتكففون الناس وإنك لن تنفق نفقة تبتغي بها وجه الله إلا
~~أجرت عليها حتى ما تجعل في في امرأتك ] قال فقلت : يا رسول الله أخلف بعد
~~أصحابي ؟ قال : [ إنك لن تخلف فتعمل عملا تبتغي به وجه الله إلا ازددت به
~~درجة ورفعة ولعلك أن تخلف حتى ينتفع بك أقوام ويضر بك آخرون اللهم أمض
~~لأصحابي هجرتهم ولا تردهم على أعقابهم لكن البائس سعد بن خولة ] يرثي له
~~رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم أن مات بمكة . متفق عليه . 6- abu ishaq
~~sa`d bin abu waqqas (may allah be pleased with him) (one of the ten who
~~had been given the glad tidings of entry into jannah) narrated:
~~messenger of allah (pbuh) visited me in my illness which became severe
~~in the year of hajjat-ul-wada` (farewell pilgrimage). i said, "o
~~messenger of allah, you can see the pain which i am suffering and i am a
~~man of means and there is none to inherit from me except one daughter.
~~should i give two-thirds of my property in charity?'' he (pbuh) said,
~~"no". i asked him, "then half?'' he said, "no". then i asked, "can i
~~give away one-third". he said, "give away one-third, and that is still
~~too much. it is better to leave your heirs well-off than to leave them
~~poor, begging people. you will not expend a thing in charity for the
~~sake of allah, but you will be rewarded for it; even the morsel of food
~~which you feed your wife''. i said, "o messenger of allah, would i
~~survive my companions?'' he said, "if you survive others and accomplish
~~a thing for the sake of allah, you would gain higher ranking and
~~standing. you will survive them ... your survival will be beneficial to
~~people (the muslim) and harmful to others (the enemies of islam). you
~~will survive others till the people will derive benefit from you, and
~~others would be harmed by you.'' messenger of allah (pbuh) further said,
~~"o allah, complete for my companions their emigration and do not cause
~~them to retract.'' sa`d bin khaulah was unfortunate. messenger of allah
~~(pbuh) lamented his death as he died in makkah. [al-bukhari and muslim].
~~commentary: in spite of all their love for it, the companions of the
~~prophet (pbuh) did not like to die in a city from which they emigrated
~~for the sake of allah. for this reason sa`d (may allah be pleased with
~~him) was afraid of dying in makkah. the prophet (pbuh) prayed for the
~~accomplishment of sa`d's emigration and expressed regret over the
~~misfortune of sa`d bin khaulah. the latter died in makkah. conclusion:
~~1- the hadith lays down that in the course of a disease which seems to
~~prove fatal, one cannot give more than one-third of the property in
~~charity. 2- it is also emphasized that one gets reward even for what he
~~spends on his wife and children. 3- one can report to others his ailment
~~or to seek treatment and ask them to supplicate from him. 4- in the
~~matter of sadaqah (charity), which one gives to seek the pleasure of
~~allah, his closest relatives. should always have priority and preference
~~over others. PageV01P0009

# وعن أبي هريرة عبد الرحمن بن صخر رضي الله عنه قال قال رسول الله صلى
~~الله عليه و سلم : [ إن الله تعالى لا ينظر إلى أجسامكم ولا إلى صوركم ولكن
~~ينظر إلى قلوبكم ] رواه مسلم 7- abu hurairah (may allah be pleased with
~~him) narrated: messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "allah does not look at
~~your figures, nor at your attire but he looks at your hearts and
~~accomplishments". [muslim]. commentary: this hadith highlights the
~~importance of sincerity and good intention. it is, therefore, essential
~~that every noble action should be based on these two virtues; and heart
~~should be free from all such things that destroy noble deeds. hypocrisy,
~~ostentation, greed for wealth, riches and other wordly things fall in
~~the category of such evils. since the true condition of heart is known
~~to allah alone, the true position of one's actions will be known on the
~~day of resurrection when one will be requited for them by alah. in this
~~world, one will be treated according to his apparent condition while his
~~insight will be left to allah. PageV01P0010

# وعن أبي موسى عبد الله بن قيس الأشعري رضي الله عنه قال : سئل رسول الله
~~صلى الله عليه و سلم عن الرجل يقاتل شجاعة ويقاتل حمية ويقاتل رياء أي ذلك
~~في سبيل الله ؟ فقال رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم : [ من قاتل لتكون كلمة
~~الله هي العليا فهو في سبيل الله ] متفق عليه. 8- abu musa al-ash`ari (may
~~allah be pleased with him) reported that messenger of allah (pbuh) was
~~asked about who fights in the battlefield out of valour, or out of zeal,
~~or out of hypocrisy, which of this is considered as fighting in the
~~cause of allah? he said: "he who fights in order that the word of allah
~~remains the supreme, is considered as fighting in the cause of allah".
~~[al-bukhari and muslim]. commentary: since one's action will be
~~evaluated in terms of intention, so he alone would be a mujahid (warrior
~~in the cause of deen) who fights to glorify the name of allah.

# وعن أبي بكرة نفيع بن الحارث الثقفي رضي الله عنه أن النبي صلى الله
~~عليه و سلم قال : [ إذا التقى المسلمان بسيفيهما فالقاتل والمقتول في النار
~~] قلت : يا رسول الله هذا القاتل فما بال المقتول ؟ قال : [ إنه كان حريصا
~~على قتل صاحبه ] متفق عليه . 9- abu bakrah ath-thaqafi (may allah be
~~pleased with him) reported: the prophet (pbuh) said: "when two muslims
~~are engaged in a combat against each other with their sword's and one is
~~killed, both are doomed to hell". i said, "o messenger of allah! as to
~~the one who kills, it is understandable, but why the slain one?" he
~~(pbuh) replied: "he was eager to kill his opponent". [al-bukhari and
~~muslim]. commentary: this hadith leads to the conclusion that one would
~~be punished for such sinful intention for which he has made a firm
~~determination, and for the commitment of which he has adopted necessary
~~measures, even if he does not succeed in committing it because of
~~certain obstruction. thus determination is different from a suggestion
~~of the devil. the latter is excusable while one is accountable for his
~~determination. however, what is mentioned in the hadith will happen when
~~muslims fight among themselves for worldly honour and prejudices, and no
~~religious issue would be the cause of their conflict, because in the
~~latter case, it is possible that both might be depending on their own
~~ijtihad (exercise of opinion) for which they may be excused.

# وعن أبي هريرة رضي الله عنه قال قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم : [
~~صلاة الرجل في جماعة تزيد على صلاته في سوقه وبيته بضعا وعشرين درجة وذلك
~~أن أحدهم إذا توضأ فأحسن الوضوء ثم أتى المسجد لا يريد إلا الصلاة لا ينهزه
~~إلا الصلاة لم يخط خطوة إلا رفع بها درجة وخط عنه بها خطيئة حتى يدخل
~~المسجد فإذا دخل المسجد كان في الصلاة ما كانت الصلاة هي تحبسه والملائكة
~~يصلون على أحد كم ما دام في مجلسه الذي صلى فيه يقولون : اللهم اcم اغفر له
~~اللهم تب عليه ما لم يؤذ فيه ما لم يحدث فيه ] متفق عليه . هذا لفظ مسلم
~~وقوله صلى الله عليه و سلم : [ ينهزه ] هو بفتح الياء والهاء وبالزاي : أي
~~يخرجه وينهضه. 10- abu hurairah (may allah be pleased with him) reported
~~that: the messenger of allah (pbuh) said: "the reward for salat
~~performed by a person in congregation is more than 20 times greater than
~~that of the salat performed in one's house or shop. when one performs
~~wudu' perfectly and then proceeds to the mosque with the sole intention
~~of performing salat, then for every step he takes towards the mosque, he
~~is upgraded one degree in reward and one of his sins is eliminated until
~~he enters the mosque, and when he enters the mosque, he is considered as
~~performing salat as long as it is the salat which prevents him (from
~~leaving the mosque); and the angels keep on supplicating allah for him
~~as long as he remains in his place of prayer. they say: 'o allah! have
~~mercy on him; o allah! forgive his sins; o allah! accept his
~~repentance'. this will carry on as long as he does not pass wind". [al-
~~bukhari and muslim]. commentary: this hadith shows that although it is
~~permissible to perform salat individually in market places and houses,
~~but its collective performance in the mosque is 25, 26, or 27 times more
~~meritorious, as mentioned in other ahadith. PageV01P0013

~~ordered that the good and the bad deeds be written down. then he

~~فقالوا : إنه لا ينجيكم من هذه الصخرة إلا أن تدعوا الله بصالح أعمالكم .

~~set out until night came and they reached a cave, so they entered it. a
~~rock fell down from the mountain and blocked the entrance of the cave.
~~they said: `nothing will save you from this unless you supplicate to

~~them said: `o allah! i had parents who were old, and i used to offer
~~them milk before any of my children or slaves. one day, i went far away
~~in search of grazing and could not come back until they had slept. when

~~slightly but they were unable to escape. the next said: `o allah! i had
~~a cousin whom i loved more than any one else (in another version he
~~said: as a man can love a woman). i wanted to have sexual intercourse
~~with her but she refused. hard pressed in a year of famine, she
~~approached me. i gave her one hundred and twenty dinars on condition
~~that she would yield herself to me. she agreed and when we got together
~~(for sexual intercourse), she said: fear allah and do not break the seal
~~unlawfully. i moved away from her in spite of the fact that i loved her
~~most passionately; and i let her keep the money i had given her. o
~~allah! if i did that to seek your pleasure, then, remove the distress in
~~which we are.' the rock moved aside a bit further but they were still
~~unable to get out. the third one said: `o allah! i hired some labourers
~~and paid them their wages except one of them departed without taking his
~~due. i invested his money in business and the business prospered
~~greatly. after a long time, he came to me and said: o slave of allah!
~~pay me my dues. i said: all that you see is yours - camels, cattle,
~~goats and slaves. he said: o slave of allah! do not mock at me. i
~~assured him that i was not joking. so he took all the things and went
~~away. he spared nothing. o allah! if i did so seeking your pleasure,
~~then relieve us of our distress.' the rock slipped aside and they got
~~out walking freely". [al-bukhari and muslim]. commentary: 1- it is
~~permissible to pray through our virtuous deeds. but to make someone a
~~medium for it, is an innovation in deen which should be avoided for two
~~major reasons. firstly, there is no evidence in shari`ah to support
~~this. secondly, it is against the practice of khair-ul-qurun, the best
~~of generations. (this term is used for the first three generations of
~~muslims, the one in which the prophet (pbuh) lived and the two
~~following). 2- preference should be given to the service of parents,
~~even over the service of one's own wife and children. 3- to abstain from
~~sins out of fear of allah is a highly meritorious act. 4. labourers
~~should always be treated fairly. if someone has paid to a labourer less
~~than his due, it should be paid to him in a decent manner. 5. 4- any
~~supplication which is made sincerely, and with real sense of humbleness
~~is granted by allah 6. allah sometimes helps his pious men even in an
~~unusual manner, which is termed as karamat (wonder or marvel). thus,
~~like the miracles of the prophets, wonders of the righteous people are
~~also true. but miracles and wonders both appear with the will of allah.

# 2- chapter repentance PageV01P0016
# قال العلماء : التوبة واجبة من كل ذنب . فإن كانت المعصية بين العبد وبين
~~الله تعالى لا تتعلق بحق آدمي فلها ثلاثة شروط : أحدها أن يقلع عن المعصية
~~والثاني أن يندم على فعلها والثالث أن يعزم أن لا يعود إليها أبدا فإن فقد
~~أحد الثلاثة لم تصح توبته . وإن كانت المعصية تتعلق بآدمي فشروطها أربعة :
~~هذه الثلاثة وأن يبرأ من حق صاحبها . فأن كانت مالا أو نحوه رده إليه وإن
~~كان حد قذف ونحوه مكنه منه أو طلب عفوه وإن كانت غيبة استحله منها . ويجب
~~أن يتوب من جميع الذنوب فإن تاب من بعضها صحت توبته عند أهل الحق من ذلك
~~الذنب وبقى عليه الباقي . وقد تظاهرت دلائل الكتاب والسنة وإجماع الأمة على
~~وجوب التوبة. scholars said: it is necessary to repent from every sin. if
~~the offense involves the right of allah, not a human, then there are
~~three condition to be met in order that repentance be accepted by allah:
~~. 1- to desist from committing it . 2- to feel sorry for committing it .
~~3- to decide not to recommit it3 any repentance failing to meet any of
~~these three conditions, would not be sound. but if the sin involves a
~~human's right, it requires a fourth condition, i.e., to absolve onself
~~from such right. if it is a property, he should return it to its
~~rightful owner. if it is slandering or backbiting, one should ask the
~~pardon of the offended. one should also repent from all sins. if he
~~repents from some, his repentance would still be sound according to the
~~people of sound knowledge. he should, however, repent from the rest.
~~scriptural proofs from the book and the sunnah and the consensus of the
~~scholars support the incumbency of repentance. PageV01P0017
# قال الله تعالى ( النور 31 ) : { وتوبوا إلى الله جميعا أيها المؤمنون
~~لعلكم تفلحون } allah, the, exalted says: "and all of you beg allah to
~~forgive you, o believers, that you may be successful". (24:31) وقال
~~تعالى ( هود 3 ) : { استغفروا ربكم ثم توبوا إليه } "seek the forgiveness
~~of your rubb, and turn to him in repentance". (11:3) وقال تعالى (
~~التحريم 8 ) : { يا أيها الذين آمنوا توبوا إلى الله توبة نصوحا } "o you

# وعن أبي هريرة رضي الله عنه قال سمعت رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم
~~يقول : [ والله إني لأستغفر الله وأتوب إليه في اليوم أكثر من سبعين مرة ]
~~رواه البخاري. 13- abu hurairah (may allah be pleased with him) reported:
~~i heard messenger of allah (pbuh) saying: "by allah, i seek allah's
~~forgiveness and repent to him more than seventy times a day.'' [al-
~~bukhari]. commentary: 1- it is an inducement for seeking pardon and
~~forgiveness. the prophet (pbuh), whose past and future sins were
~~forgiven, asked allah's forigveness - then how about us, who commit sins
~~on regular basis, not to seek pardon and forgiveness from allah? 2-
~~sincere and ceaseless prayer for pardon is essential so that sins
~~committed by us unintentionally are also forgiven. the above hadith lays
~~great emphasis on seeking pardon. PageV01P0019

# وعن أبي حمزة أنس بن مالك الأنصاري خادم رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم
~~رضي الله عنه قال قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم : [ لله أفرح بتوبة
~~عبده من أحدكم سقط على بعيره وقد أضله في أرض فلاة ] متفق عليه وفي رواية
~~لمسلم [ لله أشد فرحا بتوبة عبده حين يتوب إليه من أحدكم كان على راحلته
~~بأرض فلاة فانفلتت منه وعليها طعامه وشرابه فأيس منها فأتى شجرة فاضطجع في
~~ظلها قد أيس من راحلته فبينما هو كذلك إذ هو بها قائمة عنده فأخذ بخطامها
~~ثم قال من شدة الفرح : اللهم أنت عبدي وأنا ربك أخطأ من شدة الفرح ] . 1-
~~anas bin malik al-ansari (mayallah be pleased with him) the servant of
~~the messenger of allah narrated: messenger of allah (pbuh) said,
~~"verily, allah is more delighted with the repentance of his slave than a
~~person who lost his camel in a desert land and then finds it
~~(unexpectedly)". [al-bukhari and muslim]. in another version of muslim,
~~he said: "verily, allah is more pleased with the repentance of his slave
~~than a person who has his camel in a waterless desert carrying his
~~provision of food and drink and it is lost. he, having lost all hopes
~~(to get that back), lies down in shade and is disappointed about his
~~camel; when all of a sudden he finds that camel standing before him. he
~~takes hold of its reins and then out of boundless joy blurts out: 'o
~~allah, you are my slave and i am your rubb'.he commits this mistake out
~~of extreme joy". commentary: 1- this hadith also deals with the
~~inducement and merit of repentance and pardon for sins. allah is highly
~~pleased with repentance. 2- one will not have to account for a mistake
~~made without any purpose and intention. 3. it is permissible to take an
~~oath to stress on one's pardon. 4. one can quote an instance for the
~~purpose of understanding and elaboration. PageV01P0021

# وعن أبي موسى عبد الله بن قيس الأشعري رضي الله عنه عن النبي صلى الله
~~عليه و سلم قال : [ إن الله تعالى يبسط يده بالليل ليتوب مسيء النهار ويبسط
~~يده بالنهار ليتوب مسيء الليل حتى تطلع الشمس من مغربها ] رواه مسلم. 16.
~~16- abu musa al-ash`ari (may allah be pleased with him) reported: the
~~prophet (pbuh) said: "allah, the exalted, will continue to stretch out
~~his hand in the night so that the sinners of the day may repent, and
~~continue to stretch his hand in the daytime so that the sinners of the
~~night may repent, until the sun rises from the west". [muslim].
~~commentary: this hadith confirms an essential attribute of allah, i.e.,
~~the hand which he stretches out anytime he wishes without drawing
~~similarity to it, nor interpretation. such was the attitude of the pious
~~predecessors with regards to all of the essential attributes of allah.
~~it is deduced from this hadith that if one commits a sin during any hour
~~of day or night, he should immediately seek the forgiveness of allah as
~~a result. PageV01P0022

# وعن أبي هريرة رضي الله عنه قال قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم : [

~~hurairah (may allah be pleased with him) narrated: messenger of allah
~~(pbuh) said, "he who repents before the sun rises from the west, allah
~~will forgive him". [muslim]. commentary: taubah means returning to allah
~~from sins. when a person commits a sin, he goes away from allah. when he
~~repents, he returns to allah and desires for being pardoned by him, and
~~getting near him. this returning towards him is taubah. when it is said
~~that `allah turns towards him', it means that allah accepts his
~~repentance. PageV01P0023

# وعن أبي عبد الرحمن عبد الله بن عمر بن الخطاب رضي الله عنه عن النبي
~~صلى الله عليه و سلم قال : [ إن الله عز و جل يقبل توبة العبد ما لم يغرغر
~~] رواه الترمذي وقال حديث حسن. `18- abdullah bin `umar bin al-khattab
~~(may allah be pleased with them) reported that: the prophet (pbuh) said,
~~"allah accepts a slave's repentance as long as the latter is not on his
~~death bed (that is, before the soul of the dying person reaches the
~~throat)". [at-tirmidhi, who categorised it as hadith hasan]. commentary:
~~the word ghargharah means the stage when soul is about to leave the body
~~and reaches the throat. in other words, the time when one suffers the
~~agony of death. hadith hasan means that hadith the authenticity of which
~~is connected without any technical defect. their narrators, however, are
~~next to those of hadith sahih. in the opinion of muhaddithin (hadith
~~scholars), hadith hasan is also reliable as hadith sahih. PageV01P0024

~~إذا كنا سفرا أو مسافرين أن لا ننزع خفافنا ثلاثة أيام ولياليهن إلا من

~~نعم كنا مع رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم في سفر فبينا نحن عنده إذ ناداه

~~zirr bin hubaish reported: i went to safwan bin `assal (may allah be
~~pleased with him) to inquire about wiping with wet hands over light
~~boots while performing wudu'. he asked me, "what brings you here,
~~zirr?'' i answered: "search for knowledge". he said, "angels spread
~~their wings for the seeker of knowledge out of joy for what he seeks". i
~~told him, "i have some doubts in my mind regarding wiping of wet hands
~~over light boots in the course of performing wudu' after defecation or
~~urinating. now since you are one of the companions of the prophet
~~(pbuh), i have come to ask you whether you heard any saying of the
~~prophet (pbuh) concerning it?". he replied in the affirmative and said,
~~"he (pbuh) instructed us that during a journey we need not take off our
~~light boots for washing the feet up to three days and nights, except in
~~case of major impurity (after sexual intercourse). in other cases such
~~as sleeping, relieving oneself or urinating, the wiping of wet hands
~~over light boots will suffice.'' i, then, questioned him, "did you hear
~~him say anything about love and affection?'' he replied, "we accompanied
~~the messenger of allah (pbuh) in a journey when a bedouin called out in
~~a loud voice, `o muhammad.' the messenger of allah (pbuh) replied him in
~~the same tone, `here i am.' i said to him (the bedouin), `woe to you,
~~lower your voice in his presence, because you are not allowed to do so.'
~~he said, `by allah! i will not lower my voice,' and then addressing the
~~prophet (pbuh) he said, `what about a person who loves people but has
~~not found himself in their company.' messenger of allah (pbuh) replied,
~~`on the day of resurrection, a person will be in the company of those
~~whom he loves.' the messenger of allah then kept on talking to us and in
~~the course of his talk, he mentioned a gateway in the heaven, the width
~~of which could be crossed by a rider in forty or seventy years". sufyan,
~~one of the narrators of this tradition, said: "this gateway is in the
~~direction of syria. allah created it on the day he created the heavens
~~and the earth. it is open for repentance and will not be shut until the
~~sun rises from that direction (i.e., the west) (on doomsday)". [at-
~~tirmidhi, who categorised it as hadith hasan sahih] commentary: 1- we
~~learn from this hadith that in ablution, it is permissible to wipe over
~~light boots rather than washing the feet. it is called mash. the period,
~~in which mash is intact, in case of travellers it is three days and
~~three nights; while for the residents, it is one day and one night only.
~~a precondition for it is that light boots should be clean and worn after
~~full wudu'. ankles should also be covered. in case of breach of
~~ablution, the wiping over the socks is sufficient, and there is no need
~~for washing the feet. wudu' is invalidated by sleeping, call of nature
~~and passing of wind. this is called hadath asghar. in the case of hadath
~~akbar, which occurs because of coitus, menses and wet dream, washing of
~~the whole body becomes obligatory. it means that the privilege of wiping
~~over the light boots is also finished in this case, in the same way as
~~it does after the expiry of period specified for it. 2- one should
~~associate himself with the pious people so that he is counted among
~~them. one also comes to know many other points from this hadith which
~~every intelligent person can understand with a little effort.

# وعن أبي سعيد سعد بن مالك بن سنان الخدري رضي الله عنه أن نبي الله صلى

~~له من توبة ؟ فقال لا فقتله فكمل به مائة ثم سأل عن أعلم أهل الأرض فدل على

~~بصدره نحوها ] 20. 20- abu sa`id al-khudri (may allah be pleased with
~~him) reported: prophet of allah (pbuh) said: "there was a man from among
~~a nation before you who killed ninety-nine people and then made an
~~inquiry about the most learned person on the earth. he was directed to a
~~monk. he came to him and told him that he had killed ninety-nine people
~~and asked him if there was any chance for his repentance to be accepted.
~~he replied in the negative and the man killed him also completing one
~~hundred. he then asked about the most learned man in the earth. he was
~~directed to a scholar. he told him that he had killed one hundred people
~~and asked him if there was any chance for his repentance to be accepted.
~~he replied in the affirmative and asked, `who stands between you and
~~repentance? go to such and such land; there (you will find) people
~~devoted to prayer and worship of allah, join them in worship, and do not
~~come back to your land because it is an evil place.' so he went away and
~~hardly had he covered half the distance when death overtook him; and
~~there was a dispute between the angels of mercy and the angels of
~~torment. the angels of mercy pleaded, 'this man has come with a
~~repenting heart to allah,' and the angels of punishment argued, 'he
~~never did a virtuous deed in his life.' then there appeared another
~~angel in the form of a human being and the contending angels agreed to
~~make him arbiter between them. he said, `measure the distance between
~~the two lands. he will be considered belonging to the land to which he
~~is nearer.' they measured and found him closer to the land (land of
~~piety) where he intended to go, and so the angels of mercy collected his
~~soul". [al-bukhari and muslim]. in another version: "he was found to be
~~nearer to the locality of the pious by a cubit and was thus included
~~among them". another version says: "allah commanded (the land which he
~~wanted to leave) to move away and commanded the other land (his
~~destination) to draw nearer and then he said: "now measure the distance
~~between them.' it was found that he was nearer to his goal by a hand's
~~span and was thus forgiven". it is also narrated that he drew closer by
~~a slight movement on his chest. commentary: 1- one comes to know from
~~this hadith that the gate of taubah is open even for the worst of the
~~sinners; and allah forgives everyone provided he repents sincerely, the
~~conditions for such repentance have already been discussed. 2- it is the
~~duty of a religious scholar that while discussing a problem, he should
~~keep in mind the psychological aspects of the questioner and adopt a
~~policy which neither causes a change in the injunction of allah nor make
~~the sinner reckless in his sins out of frustration. 3- when a situation
~~warrants, angels appear in the form of men on orders of allah.

# 21- abdullah bin ka`b, who served as the guide of ka`b bin malik (may
~~allah be pleased with him) when he became blind, narrated: i heard ka`b
~~bin malik (may allah be pleased with him) narrating the story of his
~~remaining behind instead of joining messenger of allah (pbuh) when he
~~left for the battle of tabuk. ka`b said: "i accompanied messenger of
~~allah (pbuh) in every expedition which he undertook excepting the battle
~~of tabuk and the battle of badr. as for the battle of badr, nobody was
~~blamed for remaining behind as messenger of allah (pbuh) and the
~~muslims, when they set out, had in mind only to intercept the caravan of
~~the quraish. allah made them confront their enemies unexpectedly. i had
~~the honour of being with messenger of allah (pbuh) on the night of
~~`aqabah when we pledged our allegiance to islam and it was dearer to me
~~than participating in the battle of badr, although badr was more well-
~~known among the people than that. and this is the account of my staying
~~behind from the battle of tabuk. i never had better means and more
~~favourable circumstances than at the time of this expedition. and by
~~allah, i had never before possessed two riding-camels as i did during
~~the time of this expedition. whenever messenger of allah (pbuh) decided
~~to go on a campaign, he would not disclose his real destination till the
~~last moment (of departure). but on this expedition, he set out in
~~extremely hot weather; the journey was long and the terrain was
~~waterless desert; and he had to face a strong army, so he informed the
~~muslims about the actual position so that they should make full
~~preparation for the campaign. and the muslims who accompanied messenger
~~of allah (pbuh) at that time were in large number but no proper record
~~of them was maintained.'' ka`b (further) said: "few were the persons who
~~chose to remain absent believing that they could easily hide themselves
~~(and thus remain undetected) unless revelation from allah, the exalted,
~~and glorious (revealed relating to them). and messenger of allah (pbuh)
~~set out on this expedition when the fruit were ripe and their shade was
~~sought. i had a weakness for them and it was during this season that
~~messenger of allah (pbuh) and the muslims made preparations. i also
~~would set out in the morning to make preparations along with them but
~~would come back having done nothing and said to myself: 'i have means
~~enough (to make preparations) as soon as i like'. and i went on doing
~~this (postponing my preparations) till the time of departure came and it
~~was in the morning that messenger of allah (pbuh) set out along with the
~~muslims, but i had made no preparations. i would go early in the morning
~~and come back, but with no decision. i went on doing so until they (the
~~muslims) hastened and covered a good deal of distance. then i wished to
~~march on and join them. would that i had done that! but perhaps it was
~~not destined for me. after the departure of messenger of allah (pbuh)
~~whenever i went out, i was grieved to find no good example to follow but
~~confirmed hypocrites or weak people whom allah had exempted (from
~~marching forth for jihad). messenger of allah (pbuh) made no mention of
~~me until he reached tabuk. while he was sitting with the people in
~~tabuk, he said, `what happened to ka`b bin malik?' a person from banu
~~salimah said: "o messenger of allah, the (beauty) of his cloak and an
~~appreciation of his finery have detained him.' upon this mu`adh bin
~~jabal (matallah be pleased with him) admonished him and said to
~~messenger of allah (pbuh): "by allah, we know nothing about him but
~~good.' messenger of allah (pbuh), however, kept quiet. at that time he
~~(the prophet (pbuh)) saw a person dressed in white and said, `be abu
~~khaithamah.' and was abu khaithamah al-ansari was the person who had
~~contributed a sa` of dates and was ridiculed by the hypocrites.'' ka`b
~~bin malik further said: "when the news reached me that messenger of
~~allah (pbuh) was on his way back from tabuk, i was greatly distressed. i
~~thought of fabricating an excuse and asked myself how i would save
~~myself from his anger the next day. in this connection, i sought the
~~counsels of every prudent member of my family. when i was told that
~~messenger of allah (pbuh) was about to arrive, all the wicked ideas
~~vanished (from my mind) and i came to the conclusion that nothing but
~~the truth could save me. so i decided to tell him the truth. it was in
~~the morning that messenger of allah (pbuh) arrived in al-madinah. it was
~~his habit that whenever he came back from a journey, he would first go
~~to the mosque and perform two rak`ah (of optional prayer) and would then
~~sit with the people. when he sat, those who had remained behind him
~~began to put forward their excuses and take an oath before him. they
~~were more than eighty in number. messenger of allah (pbuh) accepted
~~their excuses on the very face of them and accepted their allegiance and
~~sought forgiveness for them and left their insights to allah, until i
~~appeared before him. i greeted him and he smiled and there was a tinge
~~of anger in that. he then said to me, 'come forward'. i went forward and
~~i sat in front of him. he said to me, `what kept you back? could you not
~~afford to go in for a ride?' i said, 'o messenger of allah, by allah, if
~~i were to sit before anybody else, a man of the world, i would have
~~definitely saved myself from his anger on one pretext or the other and i
~~have a gifted skill in argumentation, but, by allah, i am fully aware
~~that if i were to put forward before you a lame excuse to please you,
~~allah would definitely provoke your wrath upon me. in case, i speak the
~~truth, you may be angry with me, but i hope that allah would be pleased
~~with me (and accept my repentance). by allah, there is no valid excuse
~~for me. by allah, i never possessed so good means, and i never had such
~~favourable conditions for me as i had when i stayed behind.' thereupon,
~~messenger of allah (pbuh) said, 'this man spoke the truth, so get up
~~(and wait) until allah gives a decision about you.' i left and some
~~people of banu salimah followed me. they said to me, `by allah, we do
~~not know that you committed a sin before. you, however, showed inability
~~to put forward an excuse before messenger of allah (pbuh) like those who
~~stayed behind him. it would have been enough for the forgiveness of your
~~sin that messenger of allah (pbuh) would have sought forgiveness for
~~you.' by allah, they kept on reproaching me until i thought of going
~~back to messenger of allah (pbuh) and retract my confession. then i said
~~to them, 'has anyone else met the same fate?' they said, 'yes, two
~~persons have met the same fate. they made the same statement as you did
~~and the same verdict was delivered in their case.' i asked, `who are
~~they?' they said, 'murarah bin ar-rabi` al-`amri and hilal bin umaiyyah
~~al-waqifi.' they mentioned these two pious men who had taken part in the
~~battle of badr and there was an example for me in them. i was confirmed
~~in my original resolve. messenger of allah (pbuh) prohibited the muslims
~~to talk to the three of us from amongst those who had stayed behind. the
~~people began to avoid us and their attitude towards us changed and it
~~seemed as if the whole atmosphere had turned against us, and it was in
~~fact the same atmosphere of which i was fully aware and in which i had
~~lived (for a fairly long time). we spent fifty nights in this very state
~~and my two friends confined themselves within their houses and spent
~~(most of their) time weeping. as i was the youngest and the strongest, i
~~would leave my house, attend the congregational salat, move about in the
~~bazaars, but none would speak to me. i would come to messenger of allah
~~(pbuh) as he sat amongst (people) after the salat, greet him and would
~~ask myself whether or not his lips moved in response to my greetings.
~~then i would perform salat near him and look at him stealthily. when i
~~finish my salat, he would look at me and when i would cast a glance at
~~him he would turn away his eyes from me. when the harsh treatment of the
~~muslims to me continued for a (considerable) length of time, i walked
~~and i climbed upon the wall of the garden of abu qatadah, who was my
~~cousin, and i had a great love for him. i greeted him but, by allah, he
~~did not answer to my greeting. i said to him, `o abu qatadah, i adjure
~~you in the name of allah, are you not aware that i love allah and his
~~messenger (pbuh)?' i asked him the same question again but he remained
~~silent. i again adjured him, whereupon he said, `allah and his messenger
~~(pbuh) know better.' my eyes were filled with tears, and i came back
~~climbing down the wall. as i was walking in the bazaars of al-madinah,
~~a man from the syrian peasants, who had come to sell food grains in al-
~~madinah, asked people to direct him to ka`b bin malik. people pointed
~~towards me. he came to me and delivered a letter from the king of
~~ghassan, and as i was a scribe, i read that letter whose purport was:
~~`it has been conveyed to us that your friend (the prophet (pbuh)) was
~~treating you harshly. allah has not created you for a place where you
~~are to be degraded and where you cannot find your right place; so come
~~to us and we shall receive you graciously.' as i read that letter i
~~said: 'this is too a trial,' so i put it to fire in an oven. when forty
~~days had elapsed and messenger of allah (pbuh) received no revelation,
~~there came to me a messenger of the messenger of allah and said,
~~`verily, messenger of allah (pbuh) has commanded you to keep away from
~~your wife.' i said, `should i divorce her or what else should i do?' he
~~said, `no, but only keep away from her and don't have sexual contact
~~with her.' the same message was sent to my companions. so, i said to my
~~wife: 'you better go to your parents and stay there with them until
~~allah gives the decision in my case.' the wife of hilal bin umaiyyah
~~came to messenger of allah (pbuh) and said: 'o messenger of allah, hilal
~~bin umaiyyah is a senile person and has no servant. do you disapprove if
~~i serve him?' he said, `no, but don't let him have any sexual contact
~~with you.' she said, 'by allah, he has no such desire left in him. by
~~allah, he has been in tears since (this calamity) struck him.' members
~~of my family said to me, `you should have sought permission from
~~messenger of allah (pbuh) in regard to your wife. he has allowed the
~~wife of hilal bin umaiyyah to serve him.' i said, 'i would not seek
~~permission from messenger of allah (pbuh) for i do not know what
~~messenger of allah might say in response to that, as i am a young man'.
~~it was in this state that i spent ten more nights and thus fifty days
~~had passed since people boycotted us and gave up talking to us. after i
~~had offered my fajr prayer on the early morning of the fiftieth day of
~~this boycott on the roof of one of our houses, and had sat in the very
~~state which allah described as: `the earth seemed constrained for me
~~despite its vastness', i heard the voice of a proclaimer from the peak
~~of the hill sal` shouting at the top of his voice: 'o ka`b bin malik,
~~rejoice.' i fell down in prostration and came to know that there was (a
~~message of) relief for me. messenger of allah (pbuh) had informed the
~~people about the acceptance of our repentance by allah after he had
~~offered the fajr prayer. so the people went on to give us glad tidings
~~and some of them went to my companions in order to give them the glad
~~tidings. a man spurred his horse towards me (to give the good news), and
~~another one from the tribe of aslam came running for the same purpose
~~and, as he approached the mount, i received the good news which reached
~~me before the rider did. when the one whose voice i had heard came to me
~~to congratulate me, i took off my garments and gave them to him for the
~~good news he brought to me. by allah, i possessed nothing else (in the
~~form of clothes) except these garments, at that time. then i borrowed
~~two garments, dressed myself and came to messenger of allah (pbuh) on my
~~way, i met groups of people who greeted me for (the acceptance of)
~~repentance and they said: 'congratulations for acceptance of your
~~repentance.' i reached the mosque where messenger of allah (pbuh) was
~~sitting amidst people. talhah bin `ubaidullah got up and rushed towards
~~me, shook hands with me and greeted me. by allah, no person stood up (to
~~greet me) from amongst the muhajirun besides him.'' ka`b said that he
~~never forgot (this good gesture of) talhah. ka`b further said: "i
~~greeted messenger of allah (pbuh) with `as-salamu `alaikum' and his face
~~was beaming with pleasure. he (pbuh) said, `rejoice with the best day
~~you have ever seen since your mother gave you birth. 'i said: `o
~~messenger of allah! is this (good news) from you or from allah?' he
~~said, `no, it is from allah.' and it was common with messenger of allah
~~(pbuh) that when ever he was happy, his face would glow as if it were a
~~part of the moon and it was from this that we recognized it (his
~~delight). as i sat before him, i said, i have placed a condition upon
~~myself that if allah accepts my taubah, i would give up all of my
~~property in charity for the sake of allah and his messenger (pbuh)!'
~~thereupon messenger of allah (pbuh) said, `keep some property with you,
~~as it is better for you.' i said, 'i shall keep with me that portion
~~which is in khaibar'. i added: 'o messenger of allah! verily, allah has
~~granted me salvation because of my truthfulness, and therefore,
~~repentance obliges me to speak nothing but the truth as long as i am
~~alive.'' ka`b added: "by allah, i do not know anyone among the muslims
~~who has been granted truthfulness better than me since i said this to
~~the prophet (pbuh). by allah! since the time i made a pledge of this to
~~messenger of allah (pbuh), i have never intended to tell a lie, and i
~~hope that allah would protect me (against telling lies) for the rest of
~~my life. allah, the exalted, the glorious, revealed these verses:
~~'allah has forgiven the prophet (pbuh), the muhajirun (muslim emigrants
~~who left their homes and came to al-madinah) and the ansar (muslims of
~~al-madinah) who followed him (muhammad (pbuh)) in the time of distress
~~(tabuk expedition), after the hearts of a party of them had nearly
~~deviated (from the right path), but he accepted their repentance.
~~certainly, he is unto them full of kindness, most merciful. and (he did
~~forgive also) the three who did not join [the tabuk expedition and whose
~~case was deferred (by the prophet (pbuh)) for allah's decision] till for
~~them the earth, vast as it is, was straitened and their ownselves were
~~straitened to them, and they perceived that there is no fleeing from
~~allah, and no refuge but with him. then, he forgave them (accepted their
~~repentance), that they might beg for his pardon [repent (unto him)].
~~verily, allah is the one who forgives and accepts repentance, most
~~merciful. o you who believe! be afraid of allah, and be with those who
~~are true (in word and deeds).'' (9:117,118). ka`b said: "by allah,
~~since allah guided me to islam, there has been no blessing more
~~significant for me than this truth of mine which i spoke to messenger of
~~allah (pbuh), and if i were to tell a lie i would have been ruined as
~~were ruined those who had told lies, for allah described those who told
~~lies with the worst description he ever attributed to anybody else, as
~~he sent down the revelation: they will swear by allah to you (muslims)
~~when you return to them, that you may turn away from them. so turn away
~~from them. surely, they are rijsun [i.e., najasun (impure) because of
~~their evil deeds], and hell is their dwelling place - a recompense for
~~that which they used to earn. they (the hypocrites) swear to you
~~(muslims) that you may be pleased with them, but if you are pleased with
~~them, certainly allah is not pleased with the people who are al-fa'siqun
~~(rebellious, disobedient to allah)". (9:95,96) ka`b further added: "the
~~matter of the three of us remained pending for decision apart from the
~~case of those who had made excuses on oath before messenger of allah
~~(pbuh) and he accepted those, took fresh oaths of allegiance from them
~~and supplicated for their forgiveness. the prophet (pbuh) kept our
~~matter pending till allah decided it. the three whose matter was
~~deferred have been shown mercy. the reference here is not to our staying
~~back from the expedition but to his delaying our matter and keeping it
~~pending beyond the matter of those who made their excuses on oath which
~~he accepted". [al-bukhari and muslim] another version adds: "messenger
~~of allah (pbuh) set out for tabuk on thursday. he used to prefer to set
~~out on journey on thursday.'' another version says: "messenger of allah
~~(pbuh) used to come back from a journey in the early forenoon and went
~~straight to the mosque where he would perform two rak`ah prayer.
~~afterwards he would seat himself there". commentary: this hadith
~~contains many aspects of warnings and advices, some of which are given
~~below: 1- a muslim should always speak the truth even if he has to face
~~troubles and turmoil for it because the pleasure of allah lies in truth
~~2- one must avoid at all costs the attitude of hypocrites because
~~eventually one is ruined by it. 3- in spite of hardship and stringency,
~~one must take part in jihad. 4- for the admonition and exhortation of
~~others, it gives justification for the economic boycott of even sincere
~~muslims who adopt wrong methods. 5- one must face with forbearance the
~~difficulties which come in the way of deen. 6- it is not praiseworthy
~~that one gives in charity all the property he has. one must keep what is
~~needed for the lawful needs. 7- it is lawful to give something by way of
~~gift and reward to a person who congratulates in the events of
~~happiness.8- the ability to seek pardon is a gift from allah for which
~~one must express gratitude to him. .9- any promise that one makes must
~~be kept, etc. etc PageV01P0027

# وعن أبي نجيد - بضم النون وفتح الجيم - عمران بن الحصين الخزاعي رضي
~~الله عنهما أن امرأة من جهينة أتت رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم وهي حبلى
~~من الزنا فقالت : يا رسول الله أصبت حدا فأقمه علي . فدعا نبي الله صلى
~~الله عليه و سلم وليها فقال : [ أحسن إليها فإذا وضعت فائتني ] ففعل فأمر
~~بها نبي الله صلى الله عليه و سلم فشدت عليها ثيابها ثم أمر بها فرجمت ثم
~~صلى عليها . فقال له عمر : تصلي عليها يا رسول الله وقد زنت ؟ قال : [ لقد

~~جادت بنفسها لله عز و جل ؟ ] رواه مسلم 22. imran bin al-husain al-khuza`i
~~(may allah be pleased with him) reported: a woman from the tribe
~~juhainah came to messenger of allah (pbuh) while she was pregnant from
~~(zina) adultery and said to him: "o messenger of allah! i have committed
~~an offense liable to hadd (prescribed punishment), so exact the
~~execution of the sentence.'' messenger of allah (pbuh) called her
~~guardian and said to him, "treat her kindly. bring her to me after the
~~delivery of the child.'' that man complied with the orders. at last the
~~prophet (pbuh) commanded to carry out the sentence. her clothes were
~~secured around her and she was stoned to death. the prophet (pbuh) led
~~her funeral prayers. `umar submitted: "o messenger of allah! she
~~committed zina and you have performed funeral prayer for her?'' he
~~replied, "verily, she made repentance which would suffice for seventy of
~~the people of al-madinah if it is divided among them. can there be any
~~higher degree of repentance than that she sacrificed her life
~~voluntarily to win the pleasure of allah, the exalted?''. [muslim].
~~commentary: this hadith highlights the following five points: 1. it
~~confirms the validity of the punishment of rajm for the adulterer, that
~~is to say that he should be stoned to death. 2. the merit of sincere
~~pardon. 3.the description of fear of allah as well as of accountability
~~on the day of resurrection by the prophet's companions, and their
~~preference for punishment of sins in this world rather than in the
~~hereafter. 4. it is permissible to perform the funeral prayer of one
~~who has been guilty of major sins, provided he has not been taking them
~~as lawful because in that case there is danger of disbelief.. 5. a
~~pregnant woman cannot be punished with rajm until she gives birth to the
~~child and the period specified for suckling the baby is completed.

~~وما أعطي أحد عطاء خيرا وأوسع من الصبر ] متفق عليه. . 26- abu sa'id al-
~~khudri (may allah be pleased with him) reported that: certain people of
~~the ansar asked the messenger of allah (pbuh) and he gave them; then
~~they again asked him and he gave them until all what he possessed was
~~exhausted. then the prophet (pbuh) said, "whatever wealth i have, i will
~~not withhold from you. whosoever would be chaste and modest; allah will
~~keep him chaste and modest and whosoever would seek self-sufficiency,
~~allah will make him self-sufficient; and whosoever would be patient,

~~[muslim]. commentary: a muslim is required to behave in poverty and
~~prosperity, affluence and hardship, in the manner stated in this hadith.
~~it means that to forget allah in prosperity, rather than being thankful
~~to him for his favour is defiance of his orders. similarly, it is

~~fatimah (may allah be pleased with her) exclaimed: "ah, the distress of
~~my dear father.'' he (pbuh) said, "there will be no distress for your

~~also permissible. to remember the virtues of the deceased is also
~~permitted but it is to be free from wailing and moaning, lamentation and

~~is compassionate only to those among his slaves who are compassionate
~~(to others)". another version says: messenger of allah (pbuh) said,

~~however, their participation in the funeral prayer is mustahab fard
~~kifayah (a desirable collective duty upon all muslims; but which is
~~sufficient or equivalent to all having performed it if it is performed
~~by only some of them). 2. the desire of the relatives that at the time
~~of someone's death some pious people should be present is quite genuine
~~so that the agonizing process of death is made easy by their prayers. 3.
~~it is lawful that a trustworthy person is made to take an oath and it is
~~essential for the trustee to fulfill it as it increases the mutual trust
~~and love. 4. to shed tears on someone's death, and to advice the
~~relatives of the deceased for patience and accountability are

# 30. 30- suhaib (may allah be pleased with him) reported that the
~~messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "there lived a king before you and he
~~had a court magician. as he (the magician) grew old, he said to the
~~king: `i have grown old, so send me a young boy in order to teach him
~~magic.' the king sent him a young boy to serve the purpose. and on his
~~way (to the magician) the young boy met a monk to whom he listened to
~~and liked it. it became his habit that on his way to the magician, he
~~would meet the monk and sit there and would come to the magician (late).
~~the magician used to beat him because of this delay. he complained about
~~this to the monk who said to him: 'when you feel afraid of the magician,
~~say: members of my family detained me. and when you fear your family,
~~say: the magician detained me.' it so happened that there came a huge
~~beast and it blocked the way of the people, and the young boy said: 'i
~~will know today whether the magician or the monk is better.' he picked
~~up a stone and said: `o allah, if the way of the monk is dearer to you
~~than the way of the magician, bring about death to the animal so that
~~the people be able to move about freely.' he threw that stone at it and
~~killed it and the people began to move about freely. he then came to the
~~monk and told him the story. the monk said: `son, today you are superior
~~to me. you have come to a stage where i feel that you would be soon put
~~to a trial, and in case you are put to a trial, do not reveal me.' that
~~young boy began to heal those born blind and the lepers and he, in fact,
~~began to cure people from all kinds of illnesses. when a courtier of the
~~king who had gone blind heard about him, he came to him with numerous
~~gifts and said, `if you cure me, all these things will be yours.' he
~~said, `i myself do not cure anyone. it is allah, the exalted, alone who
~~cures; and if you affirm faith in allah, i shall also supplicate to
~~allah to cure you.' this courtier affirmed his faith in allah and allah
~~cured him. he came to the king and sat by his side as he used to sit
~~before. the king said to him, `who restored your eyesight?' he said, `my
~~rubb.' thereupon he said, 'do you have another lord besides me?' he
~~said, `my rubb and your rubb is allah.' so the king kept torturing him
~~untill he revealed the young boy. the young boy was thus summoned and
~~the king said to him, 'o boy, it has been conveyed to me that you have
~~become so much proficient in your magic that you cure the blind and the
~~lepers and you do such and such.' thereupon he said, `i do not cure
~~anyone; it is allah alone who cures,' and the king took hold of him and
~~began to torture him until he revealed of the monk. the monk was
~~summoned and it was said to him: `you should turn back from your
~~religion.' but he refused. the king sent for a saw, placed it in the
~~middle of his head and cut him into two parts that fell down. then the
~~courtier of the king was brought forward and it was said to him: `turn
~~back from your religion.' he, too, refused, and the saw was placed in
~~the midst of his head and he was torn into two parts. then the boy was
~~sent for and it was said to him: `turn back from your religion.' he
~~refused. the king then handed him over to a group of his courtiers, and
~~said to them: `take him to such and such mountain; make him climb up
~~that mountain and when you reach its peak ask him to renounce his faith.
~~if he refuses to do so, push him to his death.' so they took him and
~~made him climb up the mountain and he said: `o allah, save me from them
~~in any way you like,' and the mountain began to shake and they all fell
~~down (dead) and that young boy came walking to the king. the king said
~~to him, `what happened to your companions?' he said, `allah has saved me
~~from them.' he again handed him to some of his courtiers and said: `take
~~him and carry him in a boat and when you reach the middle of the sea,
~~ask him to renounce his religion. if he does not renounce his religion
~~throw him (into the water).' so they took him and he said: `o allah,
~~save me from them.' the boat turned upside down and they all drowned
~~except the young boy who came walking to the king. the king said to him,
~~`what happened to your companions?' he said, `allah has saved me from
~~them,' and he said to the king: `you cannot kill me until you do what i
~~command you to do.' the king asked, `what is that?' he said, `gather all
~~people in one place and tie me up to the trunk of a tree, then take an
~~arrow from my quiver and say: with the name of allah, the rubb of the
~~boy; then shoot me. if you do that you will be able to kill me.' `the
~~king called the people in an open field and tied the young boy to the
~~trunk of a tree. he took out an arrow from his quiver, fixed in the bow
~~and said, `with the name of allah, the rubb of the young boy,' he then
~~shot the arrow and it hit the boy's temple. the young boy placed his
~~hand upon the temple where the arrow had hit him and died. the people
~~then said: `we believe in the rubb of this young boy.' the king was
~~told: `do you see what you were afraid of, by allah it has taken place;
~~all people have believed.' the king then commanded that trenches be dug
~~and fire lit in them, and said: `he who would not turn back from his
~~(the young boy's) religion, throw him in the fire' or `he would be
~~ordered to jump into it.' they did so till a woman came with her child.
~~she felt hesitant in jumping into the fire. the child said to her: `o
~~mother! endure (this ordeal) for you are on the right path". [muslim].
~~commentary: 1. the most important lesson of this hadith is that whatever
~~difficulties one has to face on the path of deen, he should endure it
~~with patience and determination; and if interest of the deen requires,
~~one should sacrifice his life for it. 2. the wonders displayed by
~~righteous people are true. when allah's will and wisdom requires, he
~~manifests these wonders through his slaves. 3. it is a proof of the
~~truth of the qur'an that it has retold the great historical event like
~~ashab-ul-ukhdud which, buried in the dust of ages, had long been
~~forgotten. 4. it is not possible to explain and interpret the qur'an
~~without the help of ahadith. the event of ashsb-ul-ukhdud mentioned in
~~the qur'an is an instance in point. it is the hadith that has brought
~~into light the details of the event and clarified its ambiguity. 5. such
~~incidents are a source of strength for the faith of true believers.

~~a punishment which allah sends upon whomsoever he wills, but allah has
~~made it as a mercy to the believers. anyone who remains in a town which
~~is plagued with pestilence maintaining patience expecting the reward
~~from allah, and knowing that nothing will befall him other than what
~~allah has foreordained for him, he would receive a reward of shaheed".
~~[al-bukhari]. commentary: to endure patiently in a city where one
~~resides when it is affected by plague or such other epidemics, and not
~~to flee from it, elevates a muslim to the level of shahadah in the way
~~of allah, as is the case in certain other circumstances, like death by
~~drowning or in maternity, etc. this order is based on the consideration
~~that the epidemic should not spread to other cities. on the other hand,
~~residents of other cities are ordered to refrain from visiting the
~~affected city. the hadith clearly shows that it does not go against
~~faith in allah to take steps necessary for prevention and cure.
~~similarly, patience in the event of sickness is a proof of one's perfect
~~faith in the will of allah. PageV01P0041

~~stricken with a discomfort, an illness, an anxiety, a grief or mental
~~worry or even the pricking of a thorn but allah will expiate his sins on
~~account of his patience". [al-bukhari and muslim]. commentary: this
~~hadith mentions the special grace and mercy of allah for the muslims. it
~~relates how allah turns the hardships and troubles suffered by a muslim
~~into a means of expiation for his sins. but this is only possible if the
~~believer exercises patience. however, if he starts wailing instead of
~~showing patience then beside suffering hardships, he would be deprived
~~of the reward which lies in bearing them patiently. thus, he shall have
~~to take the burden of additional sins also. PageV01P0045

~~. 38- ibn mas`ud (may allah be pleased with him) reported: i visited the
~~prophet (pbuh) when he was suffering fever. i said, "you seem to be
~~suffering greatly, o messenger of allah.'' the prophet (pbuh) replied,
~~"yes, i suffer as much as two persons.'' i said, "is that because you
~~have a double reward?'' he replied that that was so and then said, "no
~~muslim is afflicted by a harm, be it the pricking of a thorn or
~~something more (painful than that), but allah thereby causes his sins to
~~fall away just as a tree sheds its leaves". [al-bukhari and muslim].
~~commentary: prophets have to face more than ordinary troubles and for
~~that reason their reward to bear them is also increased. thus, the
~~excess of hardships and grief is a sign of perfect faith and not a sign
~~of allah's displeasure. PageV01P0046

~~troubles of this world like grief, calamity, disease, poverty, loss of

~~anas (may allah be pleased with him) reported that: the messenger of

~~misfortune which befalls him. if he cannot help doing so, he should say:
~~'o allah, keep me alive as long as you know that life is better for me,
~~and make me die when death is better for me". [al-bukhari and muslim].
~~commentary: since man has no knowledge of his future, whether it is good
~~or bad, so one should never desire for one's own death in consequence of
~~frustration created by troubles and turmoil for two reasons. firstly,
~~desire for death is sheer impatience. secondly, it is quite possible
~~that remaining part of his life may be good for his religious and
~~worldly life. so, it is prohibited to desire death. it is, however,
~~permissible to desire for shahadah or death in makkah or al-madinah but
~~it is a subject quite different from the one under discussion. however,

~~ولكنكم تستعجلون ] رواه البخاري وفي رواية : [ وهو متوسد بردة وقد لقينا من
~~المشركين شدة ]. . 41- khabbab bin al-aratt (may allah be pleased with

~~the persecution inflicted upon us by the disbelievers while he was lying
~~in the shade of the ka`bah, having made a pillow of his cloak. we
~~submitted: "why do you not supplicate for our prevalence (over the
~~opponents)?''. he (pbuh) replied, "among those people before you, a man
~~would be seized and held in a pit dug for him in the ground and he would
~~be sawed into two halves from his head, and his flesh torn away from his
~~bones with an iron comb; but, in spite of this, he would not wean away
~~from his faith. by allah, allah will bring this matter to its
~~consummation until a rider will travel from san`a' to hadramout fearing
~~none except allah, and except the wolf for his sheep, but you are in too
~~much of a hurry". [al-bukhari]. another narration is: he (pbuh) had
~~placed his cloak under his head and we had been tortured by the
~~polytheists. commentary: . 1- difficulties in the path of faith do not
~~come in any particular period. people devoted to their deen have passed
~~through trials and tribulations everywhere and in every age and have
~~emerged purified as does the gold after passing through the furnace. so,
~~it is unbecoming for a muslim to be disturbed by hardships. . 2- the

~~and security are distinctive features of the system of that country.

~~aqra` bin habis and `uyainah bin hisn a hundred camels each and showed

~~patient.'' having heard this i said to myself: "i shall never convey
~~anything of this kind to him in future". [al-bukhari and muslim].
~~commentary: this hadith leads to the conclusion that the leader of the
~~people or the calipha has a right, if situation demands, to give to the
~~new muslims and other influential and respectable people of the society
~~more than others for their satisfaction and encouragement. the man who
~~raised objection on the distribution of booty by the prophet (pbuh) was
~~a hypocrite. devout muslims could never think that the prophet (pbuh)
~~could be unjust to anyone. this incident also goes to prove that the
~~prophet (pbuh) also felt as much as others did, the things which
~~infuriated or pleased others, because he was a man and not a superhuman
~~being. PageV01P0050

# . 44- anas (may allah be pleased with him) reported: one of the sons
~~of abu talhah (may allah be pleased with him) was ailing. abu talhah
~~went out and the boy died in his absence. when he came back, he
~~inquired, "how is the boy?''. umm sulaim, the mother of the boy,
~~replied, "better than before". then she placed his evening meal before
~~him and he ate it; and thereafter slept with her. at last, she said to
~~him: "arrange for the burial of the boy". in the morning, abu talhah
~~went to messenger of allah (pbuh) and informed him of the event. he
~~enquired, "did you sleep together last night?'' abu talhah replied in
~~the affirmative, on which the prophet (pbuh) supplicated, "o allah bless
~~them.'' thereafter, she gave birth to a boy. abu talhah said to me:
~~"take up the boy and carry him to the prophet (pbuh)''; and he sent some
~~dates with him. the prophet (pbuh) enquired, "is there anything with
~~him?'' he said; "yes, some dates". the prophet (pbuh) took a date,
~~chewed it and put it in the mouth of the baby and rubbed the chewed date
~~around the baby's gum and named him `abdullah. [al-bukhari and muslim].
~~the narration in bukhari adds: ibn `uyainah relates that a man from the
~~ansar told him that he had seen nine sons of this `abdullah, every one
~~of whom had committed the noble qur'an to memory. the narration of
~~muslim says: the son of abu talhah (may allah be pleased with him) who
~~was born of umm sulaim died. she (umm sulaim) said to the members of the
~~family: "do not tell abu talhah about his son until i mention it to him
~~myself.'' abu talhah came (home) and she gave him supper. he ate and
~~drank. she then beautified herself the best way she ever did and he
~~slept with her. when she saw that he was satisfied after sexual
~~intercourse with her, she said, "o abu talhah! if some people borrow
~~something from another family and then (the members of the family) ask
~~for its return, would they refuse to give it back to them.'' he said,
~~"no". she said, "then hope reward for your son". abu talhah got angry,
~~and said; "you left me uninformed until i stained myself (with sexual
~~intercourse) and then you told me about my son. "he went to messenger of
~~allah (pbuh) and informed him about the matter. thereupon messenger of
~~allah (pbuh) said, "may allah bless the night you spent together!'' he
~~(the narrator) said: she conceived. (one day) messenger of allah (pbuh)
~~was in the course of a journey and she was along with him. when
~~messenger of allah (pbuh) used to come back to al-madinah from a
~~journey, he would not enter it (during the night). when the people came
~~near al-madinah, she felt labour pains. he (abu talhah) remained with
~~her and messenger of allah (pbuh) proceeded on. abu talhah said: "o
~~rubb, you know that i love to go along with messenger of allah (pbuh)
~~when he goes out and enter along with him when he enters, and i have
~~been detained as you see.'' umm sulaim then said: "o abu talhah, i do
~~not feel (so much pain) as i was feeling earlier, so we better proceed
~~on. so we proceeded on and she felt the labour of delivery as they
~~reached (al-madinah). she gave birth to a male child. my mother said to
~~me: "o anas, none should suckle him until you go to messenger of allah
~~(pbuh) tomorrow morning.'' the next morning i carried the baby with me
~~to messenger of allah (pbuh), and narrated the rest of the story. [al-
~~bukhari and muslim]. commentary: this hadith has many lessons for our
~~social life. for instance: 1. the character of a woman of great patience
~~and gratitude is mentioned here. in spite of the death of her child she
~~neither wept and cried nor did she moan and mourn. she was patient to
~~the extent that when her husband came home she looked after all his
~~needs like a loving and obedient wife does and then broke the sad news
~~of the death of their child in a noble manner. thus, this hadith holds
~~the lesson that it is the foremost duty of a wife that she should serve
~~her husband well and provide comfort and peace of mind to him. 2. it is
~~meritorious for a wife to beautify herself at home for her husband. 3.
~~one who in his trouble is contented with the will of allah, certainly
~~gets a reward for it from him. 4. women can also take part with men in
~~jihad and within the prescribed limits render to mujahidun (warriors in
~~the cause of religion) the services such as dressing of the wounded,
~~welfare of the patients, supply of food, etc. PageV01P0052

~~الجاهلين . والله ما جاوزها عمر حين تلاها وكان وقافا عند كتاب الله تعالى
~~. رواه البخاري. 50- ibn `abbas (may allah be pleased with them)
~~reported: 'uyainah bin hisn came to al-madinah and stayed with his
~~nephew hurr bin qais who was among those whom umar (may allah be pleased
~~with him) showed favour to. the knowledgeable people (qurra'), whether
~~they were old or young, had the privilege of joining umar's council and
~~he used to consult them. 'uyainah said to hurr: "my nephew, the leader
~~of the believers shows favour to you. will you obtain permission for me
~~to sit with him?'' hurr asked `umar and he accorded permission. when
~~`uyainah came into the presence of `umar, he addressed him thus: "o son
~~of khattab, you neither bestow much on us nor deal with us justly.''
~~`umar (may allah be pleased with him) got angry and was about to beat
~~him up when hurr said: ``o leader of the believers, allah said to his
~~prophet (pbuh): ' show forgiveness, enjoin what is good, and turn away
~~from the foolish (i.e., don't punish them).' (7:199) this one is from
~~the ignorants. when hurr recited this, `umar became quite motionless in
~~his seat. he always adhered strictly to the book of allah. [al-bukhari].
~~commentary: 1. in this hadith, the word `qurra' does not stand for the
~~kind of the `qurra' (reciters) of the present age who are only
~~professional in the art of reciting the qur'an and have a melodious
~~voice, but what it really meant was the class of scholars who were well-
~~versed in its meanings and implications and who could thoroughly
~~distinguish between the lawful and the unlawful, fair and foul. such men
~~used to be the companions of the early noble caliphs. it leads to the
~~conclusion that rulers should choose their advisors from religious
~~scholars and not from those who are given to the world and whose sole
~~aim in life is to amass wealth rather than care about the welfare of the
~~people and whose advice is based on selfish motives and vested
~~interests. 2. since scholarship and piousness are the foremost
~~qualifications for counsellors and advisors, there is no restriction of
~~age for them. 3. the ruler should always be very considerate and
~~tolerant. 4. the ruler should never hesitate from accepting truth and
~~righteousness. PageV01P0058

~~speaking the truth till he is enrolled with allah as a truthful.
~~falsehood leads to vice and vice leads to the fire (hell), and a person
~~persists on telling lies until he is enrolled as a liar".' [agreed
~~upon]. commentary: siddiq (veracious) and kadhdhab (liar) both are
~~adjectives of intensive degree. that is to say, the words stand
~~respectively for someone whose truth has become his second nature; and
~~in the opposite case, one is a liar who is in the habit of telling lies.
~~as one acquires a reputation in this world for his good or bad deeds
~~similar is his position before allah. one who is ranked among the
~~truthful with him is entitled to reward, and if one is a liar, he has to
~~suffer retribution for it. this hadith provides incentive for

~~yet done so, or who had built houses on which he had not yet put the

~~is thief among you and every individual of your tribe must swear
~~allegiance to me". (in course of swearing of allegiance,) hands of two

~~they brought him a head of gold like a cow's head and when he laid it
~~down, the fire came and devoured the spoils. spoils were not allowed to
~~anyone before us, then allah allowed spoils to us as he saw our weakness

~~commentary: 1. in the opinion of imam as-suyuti, the prophet (pbuh)
~~referred to in this hadith was prophet yusha` bin nun (joshua). his
~~conduct shows that it is necessary to make suitable arrangements for the

~~lawfulness of the booty of war fought in the way of allah is a specialty
~~of the muslim ummah. before the advent of islam (the shar'iah of prophet
~~muhammad (pbuh)), the booty of war which was free from dishonesty used
~~to be consumed by fire. this hadith also confirms the miracle of the

~~transaction will be eliminated.'' [al-bukhari and muslim]. commentary:
~~here, the two persons engaged in business are seller and buyer. the word

~~bargain. in other words, even after the mutual acceptance of the terms
~~of the bargain so long as they are present at the spot they are entitled
~~to cancel the deal until the time they separate from each other.

~~once we were sitting in the company of messenger of allah (pbuh) when
~~there appeared a man dressed in very white clothes and having
~~extraordinary black hair. no signs of fatigue of journey appeared on him
~~and he was known to none of us. he sat down facing the prophet (pbuh)
~~leaning his knees against the knees of the prophet (pbuh) and placing
~~both of his palms over his two thighs and said, "o muhammad (pbuh)! tell
~~me about islam". he (pbuh)replied, "islam is to testify that none has
~~the right to be worshipped but allah, and that muhammad (pbuh) is the
~~messenger of allah; that you observe salat (prayers), pay zakat, observe
~~saum (fasting) of ramadan and perform hajj (pilgrimage) of the house,
~~provided you have resources of making journey to it.'' he replied: "you
~~have spoken the truth". we were surprised to see that he had asked him
~~and confirmed the correctness of the answers. he then enquired: "tell me
~~about iman". he (pbuh) said. "it is to believe in allah, and his books,
~~and his messengers and the last day and that you believe in
~~foreordainment, its bad and good consequences.'' he said, "you have
~~spoken the truth.'' he then enquired: "tell me about ihsan.'' he (pbuh)
~~said, "it is to worship allah as if you are seeing him; and although you
~~do not see him, he sees you". he enquired: "inform me about the hour
~~(i.e., the day of resurrection)". he (pbuh) replied, "i have no more
~~knowledge thereof than you". he said, "inform me about some of its
~~signs". he (pbuh) said, "they are - that a bondswoman gives birth to her
~~own master, and that you will find the barefooted, naked, poor shepherds
~~competing one another in the construction of higher buildings". then he
~~departed. the messenger of allah kept silent for a while then he said to
~~me, "o `umar! do you know who the questioner was?'' i replied, "allah
~~and his messenger know better". the prophet (pbuh) said, "he was jibril
~~(gabriel); he came to you to teach you your religion". [muslim].
~~commentary: this hadith is known as 'hadith jibril'. it mentions the
~~basics of islam the details of which are known to every muslim. al-qadr
~~(divine foreordainment) means that allah already knows and had recorded
~~everything that will happen until the day of resurrection. now whatever
~~happens is in accordance with that knowledge and writing. what is meant
~~by its good and bad consequences can be illustrated by saying that
~~tranquillity, prosperity and abundance of crops come in the category of
~~good consequences. famine, calamities and troubles, etc., fall in the
~~list as evil consequences. but we regard them good or bad according to

~~a valley full of camels, the second one, a valley full of cows and the
~~third one full of sheep. then the angel came in the form of a leper, to
~~the one who had been a leper, and said: "i am a poor man and my
~~resources have been exhausted in my journey, and my only means of
~~reaching my destination are dependent on allah and then on you, so i ask
~~you by him who gave you the good colour, the good skin and the property,
~~for a camel by which i may get to my destination". he replied: "i have
~~many dues to pay.'' the angel then said: "i think i recognize you. were
~~you not a leper whom people found loathsome and a poor man to whom allah
~~gave property?'' he replied: "i inherited this property through
~~generations". the angel said: "if you are telling a lie, may allah
~~return you to your former condition". the angel went in the form of a
~~bald man to the one who had been bald, and said the same as he had said
~~to the former and received a similar reply. so he said: "if you are
~~telling a lie, may allah return you to your former condition". the angel
~~then went to the one who had been blind and said: "i am a poor traveller
~~and my resources have been exhausted in my journey. my only means of
~~reaching my destination are dependant on allah and then on you, so i ask
~~you by him who restored your eyesight for a sheep by which i may get to
~~the end of my journey". he replied: "yes, i was blind. allah restored my
~~eyesight, so take what you wish and leave what you wish. i swear by
~~allah that i shall not argue with you today to return anything you take,
~~as i give it for allah's sake". the angel said: "keep your property. you
~~have all simply been put to a test, and allah is pleased with you and
~~displeased with both of your companions". [al-bukhari and muslim].
~~commentary: this hadith tells us that abundance of property and wealth
~~is also a trial. he alone succeeds in this trial who in the midst of his
~~riches does not forget about allah's status and his own status. rather
~~than becoming proud of his wealth, he takes pleasure in spending it in
~~fulfilling the needs of people and expresses gratitude to him in
~~practical terms. those who take an opposite course are regarded
~~unsuccessful because on account of their wrong attitude, they tend to
~~falsehood, pride and miserliness which cause the displeasure of allah..

~~ibn `abbas (may allah be pleased with them) reported: messenger of allah
~~(pbuh) said, "i was shown the past nations. i saw a prophet who had a
~~very small group (less than ten in total) with him, another prophet who
~~was accompanied by only one or two men and some did not have even one.
~~suddenly i was shown a huge crowd and i thought that they were my ummah,
~~but i was told: 'this is musa (moses) and his people, but look towards
~~the other side.' i looked and beheld a great assemblage. i was told:
~~'these are your people and amongst them there are seventy thousand who
~~shall enter jannah without being taken to account or torment". then the
~~prophet (pbuh) stood up and went into his apartment, and the companions
~~began to guess who may be those people who would enter jannah without
~~any accounting or torment. some said: "probably, they are the ones who
~~kept company with messenger of allah (pbuh)". others said: "probably,
~~they are the ones who have been born as muslims and have never
~~associated anyone with allah in worship". then messenger of allah (pbuh)
~~came out and asked, "what are you discussing?'' so they told him. he
~~then said, "they are those who do not make ruqyah (blowing over
~~themselves after reciting the qur'an or some prayers and supplications
~~the prophet (pbuh) used to say) nor seek it, nor perceive omens (i.e.,
~~they are not pessimistic) but keep trust in their rubb (allah).'' on
~~this 'ukashah bin mihsan stood up and asked: "pray to allah to make me

~~another man stood up and asked the same thing. the prophet (pbuh)
~~answered, "'ukashah has surpassed you". [al-bukhari and mulsim].

~~after reciting the qur'an or supplications of the prophet (pbuh) and
~~medical treatment are permissible but they who avoid them because of
~~their extreme trust in allah and save themselves from bad omen, enjoy a
~~distinguished position. 3. these conditions of various communities were

~~reflect the truth, or by means of revelation, or he had witnessed them

~~unsheathed. he asked: `who will protect you from me?' i replied: 'allah'
~~- thrice". he did not punish him and sat down. [al-bukhari and muslim].
~~in another narration, jabir (may allah be pleased with him) said: we
~~accompanied messenger of allah (pbuh) in the campaign of dhat-ur-riqa`.
~~we left messenger of allah (pbuh) to take rest under a shady tree. one
~~of the polytheists came to him. the sword of messenger of allah (pbuh)

~~trust in allah is helped by him. later on, the bedouin mentioned in the

~~is for so-and-so, and this for so-and-so.' lo! it has already come into
~~(the possession of) so-and-so". [al-bukhari and muslim]. commentary:
~~charity in the real sense is that which a person gives when he is
~~healthy. if a person gives charity when he is facing death, it does not
~~have much value before allah. moreover, in that condition he cannot give
~~more than one-third of his property in charity because then it becomes
~~the property of his successors, which cannot be spent even in the way of
~~allah. for this reason allah has prescribed a limit in this respect,
~~according to which if a person going through a mortal disease wants to
~~give his property in charity or donate it for some charitable purpose,
~~he cannot spend more than one-third of it on this account. this
~~injunction is an inducement for people to hurry in doing good deeds,

# وأما الأحاديث : فالأول عن أبي هريرة رضي الله عنه قال قال رسول الله
~~صلى الله عليه و سلم : [ إن الله تعالى قال : من عادى لي وليا فقد آذنته
~~بالحرب وما تقرب إلي عبدي بشيء أحب إلي مما افترضت عليه . وما يزال عبدي
~~يتقرب إلي بالنوافل حتى أحبه : فإذا أحببته كنت سمعه الذي يسمع به وبصره
~~الذي يبصر به ويده التي يبطش بها ورجله التي يمشي بها وإن سألني أعطيته
~~ولئن استعاذني لأعيذنه ] رواه البخاري [ آذنته ] : أعلمته بأني محارب له [
~~استعاذني ] روي بالنون وبالباء 95. abu hurairah (may allah be pleased
~~with him) reported: messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "allah the exalted
~~has said: 'i will declare war against him who shows hostility to a pious
~~worshipper of mine. and the most beloved thing with which my slave comes
~~nearer to me is what i have enjoined upon him; and my slave keeps on
~~coming closer to me through performing nawafil (prayer or doing extra
~~deeds besides what is obligatory) till i love him. when i love him i
~~become his hearing with which he hears, his seeing with which he sees,
~~his hand with which he strikes, and his leg with which he walks; and if
~~he asks (something) from me, i give him, and if he asks my protection
~~(refuge), i protect him". [al-bukhari]. commentary: 1. those who make
~~innovations in religion and associate partners with allah (such as
~~hululi - who believe in the indwelling light in the soul of man, wujudi
~~- who believe in the physical form of allah, and pagans who worship
~~other than allah) interpret this hadith in support of their beliefs and
~~thus seek support of one wrong from another although the meaning and
~~interpretation of the hadith is not at all what they describe. the
~~hadith means that when a person adds voluntary prayers to the obligatory
~~ones, he becomes a favourite slave of allah and on account of it, he
~~receives special help from allah. then he is protected by allah to the
~~extent that he supervises every organ of his body. thus, he is saved
~~from disobedience of allah. he bears what is liked by allah, sees what
~~is liked by him, handles what pleases him. when he attains that lofty
~~position of love and obedience of allah, then allah in return also
~~grants prayers of his obedient and loyal slaves. 2. a saint is not one
~~who has a peculiar attire and appearance, or who occupies the seat of a
~~righteous as his successor, or a person who is lost in meditation, or a
~~half-mad, or one who has invented his own style of remembrance and
~~worship of allah, but it is one who strictly fulfills the obligations
~~imposed by islam, is fond of voluntary prayers and adheres to divine
~~injunctions in every walk of life. 3. the love of such righteous is a
~~means to attain the pleasure of allah, and enmity (hatred and repulsion)
~~with them is a cause of his serious displeasure and wrath. 4. voluntary
~~prayer is certainly a means of attaining the pleasure of allah, but it
~~must be preceded by the fulfillment of obligatory prayers. the former is
~~of no value if the latter is neglected. the desire to attain nearness of
~~allah without strict observance of the obligatory prayers is fallacious
~~and meaningless. PageV01P0119

# الثاني عن أنس رضي الله عنه عن النبي صلى الله عليه و سلم فيما يرويه عن
~~ربه عز و جل قال : [ إذا تقرب العبد إلي شبرا تقربت إليه ذراعا وإذا تقرب
~~إلي ذراعا تقربت منه باعا وإذا أتاني يمشي أتيته هرولة ] رواه البخاري 96.
~~anas (may allah be pleased with him) reported: the prophet (pbuh) said,
~~"allah says: ' when a slave of mine draws near to me a span, i draw near
~~to him a cubit; and if he draws near to me a cubit, i draw near to him a
~~fathom. and if he comes to me walking, i go to him running.'''. [al-
~~bukhari]. commentary: this hadith mentions infinite benevolence,
~~generosity, kindness and regard of allah for his slaves, which is
~~evident from the reward that he gives to his slaves even on their minor
~~good deeds. PageV01P0120

# الثالث عن ابن عباس رضي الله عنه قال قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم
~~: [ نعمتان مغبون فيهما كثير من الناس : الصحة والفراغ ] رواه البخاري 97.
~~ibn abbas (may allah be pleased with him) reported: messenger of allah
~~(pbuh) said, "there are two blessings in which many people incur loss.
~~(they are) health and free time (for doing good)". [al-bukhari]
~~commentary: 1. al-ghabn in arabic means loss. what it really signifies
~~is to sell something of one's own on less than its due price, or to buy
~~something on its double or triple price. in both cases one is a loser.
~~when a person comes to know about such a loss, he repents and feels
~~sorry for it. this loss coupled with regret is called al-ghabn. in
~~ahadith, man has been compared with trader, and health and leisure
~~enjoyed by him with merchandise. one who uses his merchandise with care,
~~gains profit while he who wastes it, that is to say, uses it carelessly,
~~will be a loser on the day of resurrection. 2. the majority of people
~~do not take proper care of both these things, with the result that one
~~wastes the time in useless activities and spends the physical strength
~~and energy in the disobedience of allah. one will have to face severe
~~consequences of it on the day of resurrection when he will be brought
~~into account for everything. PageV01P0121

# الرابع عن عائشة رضي الله عنها أن النبي صلى الله عليه و سلم كان يقوم
~~من الليل حتى تتفطر قدماه . فقلت له : لم تصنع هذا يا رسول الله وقد غفر
~~الله لك ما تقدم من ذنبك وما تأخر ؟ قال : [ أفلا أحب أن أكون عبدا شكورا ]
~~متفق عليه . هذا لفظ البخاري . ونحوه في الصحيحين من رواية المغيرة بن شعبة
~~98. `aishah (may allah be pleased with her) said: the prophet (pbuh)
~~would stand (in prayer) so long that the skin of his feet would crack. i
~~asked him, "why do you do this while your past and future sins have been
~~forgiven?'' he said, "should i not be a grateful slave of allah?'' [al-
~~bukhari and muslim]. commentary: 1. all the prophets were free from
~~major sins. however, some religious scholars justify some of their minor
~~sins with plausible reasons but the majority of them maintain that they
~~are free from all sins because of their innocence. in this situation, it
~~does not make any sense to speak of their sins. but the fact of the
~~matter is quite different. anything short of excellent done by them is
~~counted as a sin. 2. the more one is rewarded by allah, the greater the
~~proportion of one's gratitude of allah for his benevolence should be.
~~the best form of doing so is that one should not only be highly obedient
~~and dutiful in the performance of the obligations but also add maximum
~~voluntary prayers to them. PageV01P0122

# الخامس عن عائشة رضي الله عنها قالت : كان رسول الله صلى الله عليه و

~~اعتزال النساء . وقيل المراد : تشميره للعبادة . يقال : شددت لهذا الأمر
~~مئزري : أي تشمرت وتفرغت له 99. `aishah (may allah be pleased with her)
~~said: with the start of the last ten days of ramadan, messenger of allah
~~(pbuh) would pray all the night, and would keep his family awake for the
~~prayers. he tied his lower garment (i.e., avoided sleeping with his
~~wives) and devoted himself entirely to prayer and supplication. [al-
~~bukhari and muslim]. commentary: one should try to do more good deeds
~~in the blessed hours and times, as was the practice of the prophet
~~(pbuh) during the last ten days of the month of ramadan every year.

# السادس عن أبي هريرة رضي الله عنه قال : قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه و
~~سلم : [ المؤمن القوي خير وأحب إلى الله من المؤمن الضعيف وفي كل خير احرص
~~على ما ينفعك واستعن بالله ولا تعجز وإن أصابك شيء فلا تقل لو أني فعلت كان
~~كذا وكذا ولكن قل : قدر الله وما شاء فعل فإن لو تفتح عمل الشيطان ] رواه
~~مسلم 100. abu hurairah (may allah be pleased with him) reported:
~~messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "a strong believer is better and dearer
~~to allah than a weak one, and both are good. adhere to that which is
~~beneficial for you. keep asking allah for help and do not refrain from
~~it. if you are afflicted in any way, do not say: `if i had taken this or
~~that step, it would have resulted into such and such,' but say only:
~~`allah so determined and did as he willed.' the word `if' opens the
~~gates of satanic thoughts". [muslim]. commentary: 1. in this hadith,
~~goodness is acknowledged in weak as well as strong because the real
~~faith is a common feature of both. the one who is stronger is, however,
~~better with allah for the reason that he is more active and energetic in
~~the matter of noble deeds and performance of ritual prayers, obligatory
~~as well as voluntary. 2. this hadith ordains that in case of trouble,
~~one should exercise patience and show submission and obedience rather
~~than saying `ifs' and `buts' about it, because it provides satan with a
~~chance to mislead the sufferer. PageV01P0124

# السابع عنه رضي الله عنه أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم قال : [ حجبت

~~] بدل [ حجبت ] وهو بمعناه : أي بينه وبينها هذا الحجاب فإذا فعله دخلها
~~101. abu hurairah (may allah be pleased with him) reported: messenger of
~~allah (pbuh) said. "the (hell) fire is surrounded with all kinds of
~~desires and passions, while jannah is surrounded with adversities.''
~~[al-bukhari and muslim]. commentary: the way to hell is littered with
~~these evils. when a person crosses them, it is an indication that he has
~~entered into hell. on the other side exists a series of griefs and
~~calamities, islamic injunctions and obligations (the compliance with
~~which is often irksome for man) impede his way to jannah. when a person
~~endures them with patience he, in fact, overcomes those obstacles and
~~becomes eligible for jannah. PageV01P0125

# الثامن عن أبي عبد الله حذيفة بن اليمان رضي الله عنه قال : صليت مع
~~النبي صلى الله عليه و سلم ذات ليلة فافتتح البقرة فقلت يركع عند المائة ثم
~~مضى فقلت يصلي بها في ركعة فمضى فقلت يركع بها ثم افتتح النساء فقرأها ثم
~~افتتح آل عمران فقرأها يقرأ مترسلا : إذا مر بآية فيها تسبيح سبح وإذا مر
~~بسؤال سأل وإذا مر بتعوذ تعوذ ثم ركع فجعل يقول : [ سبحان ربي العظيم ]
~~فكان ركوعه نحوا من قيامه ثم قال [ سمع الله لمن حمده ربنا لك الحمد ] ثم
~~قام قياما طويلا قريبا مما ركع ثم سجد فقال : [ سبحان ربي الأعلى ] فكان
~~سجوده قريبا من قيامه . رواه مسلم 102. hudhaifah (may allah be pleased
~~with him) reported: i offered salat (tahajjud - optional night prayer)
~~with the prophet (pbuh) one night, and he started reciting (surat) al-
~~baqarah. i thought that he would bow at the end of one hundred verses,
~~but he continued reciting; i, then, thought that he would perhaps recite
~~the whole (surah) in a rak`ah, but he proceeded on, and i thought he
~~would perhaps bow on completing (this surah); he then started (reciting
~~surat) an-nisa'; he then started (surat) al-`imran and his recitation
~~was unhurried. and when he recited the verses which referred to the
~~glory of allah, he glorified him (by saying subhan allah - my rubb, the
~~supreme is far removed from every imperfection), the great, and when he
~~recited the verses that mention supplication, he supplicated, and when
~~he recited the verses that mention seeking refuge of the rubb, he sought
~~(his) refuge. then he bowed and said: "my rubb, the supreme is far
~~removed from every imperfection (subhana rabbiyal-azim);'' his bowing
~~lasted about the same length of time as his standing (and then on
~~returning to the standing posture after ruku`) he said: "allah listened
~~to him who praised him (sami` allahu liman hamidah, rabbana wa lakal
~~hamd).'' then he stood about the same length of time as he had spent in
~~bowing. he then prostrated himself and said: "my rubb, the supreme is
~~far removed from every imperfection (subhana rabbiyal-a`la),'' and his
~~prostration lasted nearly the same length of time as his standing.
~~[muslim]. commentary: this hadith makes the following three points
~~clear: firstly, optional salat can also be performed in congregation.
~~secondly, as is commonly believed, it is not essential that in salat,
~~the ayat of qur'an are recited according to their sequence in the book.
~~it is permissible to recite them regardless of their sequence in the
~~qur'an. thirdly, it is commendable to relatively prolong the optional
~~prayers. PageV01P0126

~~him) said: one. night i joined the prophet (pbuh) in his (optional)
~~salat. he prolonged the standing so much that i thought of doing
~~something evil. he was asked: "what did you intend to do?'' he replied:
~~"to sit down and leave him". [al-bukhari and muslim]. commentary: 1.
~~this hadith makes it evident that opposition of imam (one who leads the
~~prayer) is an evil act because one is ordered to follow him in the
~~prayers. 2. it is permissible to ask clarification of something which
~~is ambiguous or abstruse. PageV01P0127

~~members of his family, his possessions and his deeds. two of them return
~~and one remains with him. his family and his possessions return; his
~~deeds remain with him". [al-bukhari and muslim]. commentary: this
~~hadith induces one to perform such deeds which always remain with him in
~~the grave, where every being and thing leaves one and he is all alone in
~~the grave. what is left is his good deeds which become the means of
~~refuge and salvation. PageV01P0128

~~(pbuh) said, "jannah is nearer to anyone of you than your shoe-lace, and
~~so is the (hell) fire". [al-bukhari]. commentary: going to jannah or
~~hell is the result of one's own actions, both are close to everyone. one
~~will be admitted into jannah if he does good deeds, and will be
~~consigned to hell if he does evil. after death, one's entitlement for

~~allah be pleased with him (a servant of the messenger of allah and also
~~one of the people of as-suffah) said: i used to spend my night in the
~~company of messenger of allah (pbuh) and used to put up water for his
~~ablutions. one day he said to me, "ask something of me.'' i said: "i
~~request for your companionship in jannah". he inquired, "is there
~~anything else?'' i said, "that is all.'' he said, "then help me in your
~~request by multiplying your prostrations". [muslim]. commentary: there
~~was a terrace at the end of the prophet's mosque which is called as-
~~suffah in arabic. people of poor means who were taught by him used to
~~live there. this hadith evidently shows the importance of good actions
~~and faithful following of the practice of the prophet (pbuh). leave
~~others alone, in the absence of these two, even such people will not be
~~close to the prophet (pbuh) who used to be all the time with him. it is
~~not difficult to visualize the fate of those who neither perform good
~~deeds nor follow in the footsteps of the prophet (pbuh). PageV01P0130

~~more often. for every prostration that you perform before allah will

~~against the pagans, allah will see what i do.'' so he encountered the
~~day of uhud battle. the muslims left the positions (the prophet (pbuh)
~~told them to keep) and were defeated, he said: "o allah! excuse these
~~people (i.e., the muslims) for what they have done, and i am clear from
~~what the pagans have done". then he went forward with his sword and met
~~sa`d bin mu`adh (fleeing) and said to him: "by the rubb of the ka`bah! i
~~can smell the fragrance of jannah from a place closer than uhud mount".
~~sa`d said: "o messenger of allah, what he did was beyond my power". anas

~~could give away in charity. one person presented a considerable amount
~~for charity and the hypocrites said: "he has done it to show off.''
~~another one gave away a few sa` of dates and they said: "allah does not
~~stand in need of this person's dates". thereupon, it was revealed:
~~"those who defame such of the believers who give charity (in allah's
~~cause) voluntarily, and such who could not find to give charity (in
~~allah's cause) except what is available to them...'' (9:79) [al-bukhari
~~and muslim]. * this is the a°yah in which allah says! "take sadaqah
~~(alms) from their wealth in order to purify them and sanctify them with
~~it, and suppliate allah for them...'' (9:103) commentary: this hadith
~~shows that everyone can give charitable donation according to one's
~~means. it can be more or less as one likes. to regard those as showy and
~~criticize those who pay less to withhold them from alms amounts to
~~hypocrisy. believers must ignore such criticism of the hypocrites and
~~refrain from such things in their dealings. PageV01P0134

~~everyone what he requested, that would not decrease what i have, any
~~more than a needle decrease the sea if put into it. o my slaves, it is
~~but your deeds that i reckon for you and then recompense you for, so let

~~commentary: this hadith mentions the power and majesty of allah and
~~stresses that one should supplicate allah for everything that one needs.
~~from guidance to sustenance, the treasures of everything are with him -
~~the treasures which are unlimited and any withdrawal from them does not
~~make any reduction in them. similar is the case of his sovereignty; it
~~is not affected even if the whole universe supports or opposes them.
~~thus, it is in the interest of man that he should dedicate himself
~~entirely to allah and beg all his needs from him and him alone.

~~الحديث الذي سنذكره إن شاء الله تعالى . وقيل معناه : ثماني عشرة سنة .
~~وقيل : أربعين سنة . قاله الحسن والكلبي ومسروق ونقل عن ابن عباس أيضا

~~والله أعلم allah, the exalted, says: "did we not give you lives long
~~enough, so that whosoever would receive admonition, - could receive it?
~~and the warner came to you.'' (35:37) ibn `abbas and others said that
~~"long enough'' in the verse means sixty years. the hadith which follows
~~supports this. others said it means eighteen years; al-hasan al-basri,
~~al-kalbi and masruq said it means forty years, it has also been reported
~~by ibn abbas and others that whenever the people of al-madinah turned
~~forty years of age, they would devote themselves completely to worship.
~~"long enough'' in the verse has also been interpreted to mean the age of
~~puberty. ibn `abbas and the majority of muslim scholars said that the
~~"warner'' in the verse refers to the prophet (pbuh). `ikrimah bin
~~`umaiyyah and others interpreted this word as the grayness or whiteness

# وأما الأحاديث فالأول عن أبي هريرة رضي الله عنه عن النبي صلى الله عليه
~~و سلم قال : [ أعذر الله إلى امرئ أخر أجله حتى بلغ ستين سنة ] رواه
~~البخاري قال العلماء : معناه : لم يترك له عذرا إذ أمهله هذه المدة . يقال
~~: أعذر الرجل إذا بلغ الغاية في العذر 112. abu hurairah (may allah be
~~pleased with him) reported: the prophet (pbuh) said, "allah excuses and
~~grants forgiveness to a person until he attains the age of sixty years".
~~[al-bukhari]. commentary: 1. this hadith makes it evident that allah
~~does not punish any individual or nation without warning them first. 2.
~~the second point is that a person who is given sixty years of life and
~~yet he neglects the obligations of faith, will have no excuse. 3. after
~~the age of sixty years, one must not neglect his religious obligations
~~because then one is closer to death. although one may die even at a
~~young age, in youth one is still hopeful of life. after crossing the age
~~of sixty, to hope for longer age, while leading a sinful life and
~~defying divine injunctions constitute a disastrous conduct. may allah
~~save us from doing so. PageV01P0138

~~دعاني يومئذ إلا ليريهم . قال : ما تقولون في قول الله تعالى : { إذا جاء
~~يصر الله والفتح } ؟ فقال بعضهم : أمرنا نحمد الله ونستغفره إذا نصرنا وفتح
~~علينا وسكت بعضهم فلم يقل شيئا . فقال لي : أكذلك تقول يا ابن عباس ؟ فقلت

~~with them) said: `umar (may allah be pleased with him) used to make me
~~sit with the noble elderly men who had participated in the battle of
~~badr. some of them disliked it and said to `umar: "why do you bring in
~~this boy to sit with us when we have sons like him?'' `umar replied:
~~"because of the status he has, which you already know about (i.e.,
~~belongs to the source of knowledge and the house of the prophet
~~(pbuh)).'' one day, `umar called me and seated me in the gathering of
~~those people; and i think that he called me just to show them (of my
~~religious knowledge). `umar then questioned them (in my presence). "how
~~do you interpret the ayah of allah: `when there comes the help of allah
~~(to you, o muhammad (pbuh) against your enemies) and the conquest (of
~~makkah).''' someone said that when allah's help and the conquest (of
~~makkah) came to us, we were called upon to celebrate the praise of allah
~~and ask for his forgiveness. some others remained silent and did not
~~utter a word. thereupon `umar asked me: "ibn `abbas! do you say the
~~same.'' i replied: "no". he said: "what do you say then?'' i replied:
~~"that is the sign of the prophet's death about which he had been
~~informed. allah, the exalted, says: 'when there comes the help of allah

~~accepts the repentance and who forgives". on that `umar (may allah be
~~pleased with him) said: "i do not know anything about it other than what
~~you have said". [al-bukhari] commentary: 1. this value of man does not
~~go with the length of age but with that of intellect, intelligence,
~~knowledge and consciousness. for this reason, a young boy can have
~~precedence and preference over the elders due to his clear understanding
~~and vast knowledge. 2. when a person gets closer to death, he must
~~devote himself more and more to the praise and glorification of allah
~~and beg pardon from him. PageV01P0139

~~after the revelation of (the surah) "when the help of allah comes (to

~~prayer: "subhanaka rabbana wa bihamdika, allahum-maghfir li (far removed
~~you are from every imperfection, our rubb, and all praise is for you,
~~forgive me, o allah)". [al-bukhari and muslim]. another narration is:
~~messenger of allah (pbuh) recited frequently in bowing and prostration:
~~"subhanaka rabbana wa bihamdika, allahum-maghfir li. (far removed you
~~are from every imperfection, our rubb, and all praise is for you,

~~noble qur'an to recite: "so glorify the praises of your rubb, and ask
~~for his forgiveness. verily, he is the one who accepts the repentance
~~and who forgives". (v.110:1) and he (the messenger of allah) acted upon
~~it. according to the narration in muslim, messenger of allah (pbuh)
~~frequently recited these words just before he passed away: "subhanaka

~~these new words which i hear from you repeatedly.'' he replied, "a sign
~~has been appointed for me relating to my people that i should repeat
~~these words at the sight of that sign". then he recited surat an-nasr.
~~another narration in muslim related from `aishah (may allah be pleased
~~with her) is: messenger of allah (pbuh) often recited, "glory be to
~~allah and praise be to him; i seek forgiveness of allah and turn to him
~~in repentance.'' i said to him: "o messenger of allah, i hear you recite
~~frequently: `o allah, you are free from every imperfection our rubb and

# وأما الأحاديث فكثيرة جدا وهي غير منحصرة فنذكر طرفا منها : الأول عن
~~أبي ذر جندب بن جنادة رضي الله عنه قال قلت : يا رسول الله أي الأعمال أفضل
~~؟ قال : [ الإيمان بالله والجهاد في سبيله ] قلت : أي الرقاب أفضل ؟ قال :
~~[ أنفسها عند أهلها وأكثرها ثمنا ] قلت : فإن لم أفعل ؟ قال : [ تعين صانعا

~~(may allah be pleased with him) reported: i asked: "o messenger of
~~allah! which action is the best?'' he (pbuh) said, "faith in allah and
~~jihad in the way of allah.'' i asked: "which neck (slave) is best (for
~~emancipation)?'' he said, "that which is dearest of them in price and
~~most valuable of them to its masters". i asked: "if i cannot afford
~~(it)?'' he said, "then help a labourer or work for one who is disabled".
~~i asked: "if i cannot do (it)?'' he said, "you should restrain yourself
~~from doing wrong to people, because it (serves as) charity which you
~~bestow upon yourself". [al-bukhari and muslim]. commentary: this hadith
~~shows the excellence of jihad and emancipation of slaves. it also
~~highlights the importance of co-operation and sympathy with others.
~~similarly, one who refrains from putting others into trouble, his reward
~~for it is no less than that of propitiatory offering and kindness. it
~~also tells that faith in allah is the basis for the acceptance of good
~~deeds. in fact, conduct is the fruit of one's faith. without faith
~~nothing will be acceptable by allah. PageV01P0145

# الثاني عن أبي ذر أيضا رضي الله عنه أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم
~~قال : [ يصبح على كل سلامى من أحدكم صدقة فكل تسبيحة صدقة وكل تحميدة صدقة
~~وكل تهليلة صدقة وكل تكبيرة صدقة وأمر بالمعروف صدقة ونهي عن المنكر صدقة
~~ويجزئ من ذلك ركعتان يركعهما من الضحى ] رواه مسلم [ السلامى ] بضم السين
~~المهملة وتخفيف اللام وفتح الميم : المفصل 118. abu dharr (may allah be
~~pleased with him) reported: messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "when you
~~get up in the morning, charity is due from every one of your joints.
~~there is charity in every ascription of glory to allah; there is charity
~~in every declaration of his greatness; there is charity in every
~~utterance of praise of him; there is charity in every declaration that
~~he is the only true god (worthy of worship); there is charity in
~~enjoining good; there is charity in forbidding evil. two rak`ah of duha
~~(forenoon prayer) is equal to all this (in reward)". [muslim].
~~commentary: there are three hundred and sixty joints in a human body. it
~~is these joints which enable him to work and make all kinds of
~~movements. if man's body did not have these joints it would have been
~~impossible for him to sit, stand, lie, move and make use of different
~~organs of his body. thus every joint is a blessing for which one must
~~express gratitude to allah. it is yet another blessing of allah that he
~~has also told man a very easy way of thanksgiving which can be practised
~~even by the poorest man in the world. this means of thanksgiving is
~~recitation of tasbih (subhan allah), tahmid (al-hamdu lillah), takbir
~~(allahu akbar), tahlil (la ilaha illallah), and to preach virtue and
~~forbid wrong/ unlawful, etc. if one is unable to do even this, then he
~~should perform two rak`ah prayer at any time between sunrise and sunset.

~~the condition that the eight are divided into four couplets.

~~and i found the removal of harmful objects from the road among their
~~good deeds, and phlegm which might be in a mosque left unburied among
~~their evil deeds". [muslim]. commentary: 1. allah has listed in virtue
~~even the good deed which is for the benefit of people or can save them
~~from loss. what is its opposite, however small it may be, is reckoned as
~~mischief. this hadith induces one to do good deeds to attain the
~~pleasure of allah and prevents one from evil deeds so that one is saved
~~from the displeasure of allah. 2. the hadith enjoins cleanliness of
~~mosques and forbids throwing of anything there which violates its
~~sacredness, i.e., spitting. if any such dirty thing is found there, it

~~reported: some people said to messenger of allah (pbuh): "o messenger of
~~allah, the rich have taken away (all the) reward. they observe salat
~~(prayers) as we do; and give sadaqah (charity) out of their surplus
~~wealth.'' upon this he (the prophet (pbuh)) said, "has allah not
~~prescribed for you (a course) following which you can (also) give
~~sadaqah? in every declaration of the glorification of allah (i.e.,
~~saying subhan allah) there is a sadaqah, and in every takbir (i.e.,
~~saying allahu akbar) is a sadaqah, and in every celebration of praise
~~(saying al-hamdu lillah) is a sadaqah, and in every declaration that he
~~is one (la ilaha illallah) is a sadaqah, and in enjoining of good is a
~~sadaqah, and in forbidding evil is a sadaqah, and in man's sexual
~~intercourse (with his wife) there is a sadaqah.'' they (the companions)
~~said: "o messenger of allah, is there reward for him who satisfies his
~~sexual need among us?'' he said, "you see, if he were to satisfy it with
~~something forbidden, would it not be a sin on his part? similarly, if he
~~were to satisfy it legally, he should be rewarded". [muslim].
~~commentary: this hadith highlights two important points. firstly, the
~~enthusiasm of the companions of the prophet (pbuh) for surpassing each
~~other in good actions. secondly, it tells that virtue has a vast meaning
~~in islam and it includes every action which is done with good intention,
~~provided it does not involve disobedience of allah. so much so that it
~~covers even natural activities of man which fall in the category of
~~mubah (that which is permissible and may be omitted without fear of sin)
~~and one is rewarded for them. not only that, one is rewarded even for
~~abstaining from a sin on the condition that the abstention is for the
~~obedience of allah. then abstention rises to the level of an act of
~~obedience and is rewarded likewise. PageV01P0148

~~his way he became extremely thirsty. he found a well, he went down into
~~it to drink water. upon leaving it, he saw a dog which was panting out
~~of thirst. his tongue was lolling out and he was eating moist earth from
~~extreme thirst. the man thought to himself: `this dog is extremely
~~thirsty as i was.' so he descended into the well, filled up his leather
~~sock with water, and holding it in his teeth, climbed up and quenched
~~the thirst of the dog. allah appreciated his action and forgave his
~~sins". the companions asked: "shall we be rewarded for showing kindness
~~to the animals also?'' he (pbuh) said, "a reward is given in connection
~~with every living creature". [al-bukhari and muslim]. in the narration
~~of al-bukhari, the prophet (pbuh) is reported to have said: "allah
~~forgave him in appreciation of this act and admitted him to jannah".
~~another narration says: "once a dog was going round the well and was
~~about to die out of thirst. a prostitute of banu israel happened to see
~~it. so she took off her leather sock and lowered it into the well. she
~~drew out some water and gave the dog to drink. she was forgiven on
~~account of her action". commentary: 1. this hadith emphasizes the
~~importance of kindness to every creature, even animals, because allah is
~~pleased with such kindness. 2. allah's quality of mercy and forgiveness
~~is immensely vast. if he wants he may forgive a person even on a minor
~~good action done by him. PageV01P0154

# الحادي عشر عنه رضي الله عنه عن النبي صلى الله عليه و سلم قال : [ لقد
~~رأيت رجلا يتقلب في الجنة في شجرة قطعها من ظهر الطريق كانت تؤذي المسلمين
~~] رواه مسلم وفي رواية له : [ مر رجل بغصن شجرة على ظهر طريق فقال والله
~~لأنحين هذا عن المسلمين لا يؤذيهم فأدخل الجنة ] وفي رواية لهما [ بينما
~~رجل يمشي بطريق وجد غصن شوك على الطريق فأخره فشكر الله له فغفر له ] 127.
~~abu hurairah (may allah be pleased with him) reported: the prophet
~~(pbuh) said, "i saw a man going about in jannah (and enjoying himself)
~~as a reward for cutting from the middle of the road, a tree which was
~~causing inconvenience to the muslims". [muslim]. another narration
~~says: "a man who passed by a branch of a tree leaning over a road and
~~decided to remove it, saying to himself, `by allah! i will remove from
~~the way of muslims so that it would not harm them.' on account of this
~~he was admitted to jannah". according to the narration in al-bukhari
~~and muslim: messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "while a man was walking, he
~~saw a thorny branch on the road, so he removed it and allah appreciated
~~his action and forgave him". commentary: the act of saving people from
~~harm and loss is greatly liked by allah, no matter how small it is.
~~allah is greatly pleased if a person removes from the passage something
~~that causes harm to people. on the contrary, persons who restrict or
~~obstruct passages and thereby create inconvenience for the passers-by,
~~as is usually done with great audacity on marriage parties, or create
~~trouble for people by encroachment, do in fact incur allah's
~~displeasure. but our moral sense has been so blunted that rather than
~~feeling any compunction, we do such things boastfully forgetting that
~~`truly, to allah we belong and truly, to him we shall return.' we have
~~now become so low that we take pride in going against our religious
~~teachings and practices thus incurring allah's displeasure. is there any
~~further stage of moral turpitude and revolt against him?. PageV01P0155

# الثاني عشر عنه رضي الله عنه قال قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم : [
~~من توضأ فأحسن الوضوء ثم أتى الجمعة فاستمع وأنصت غفر له ما بينه وبين
~~الجمعة وزيادة ثلاثة أيام ومن مس الحصا فقد لغا ] رواه مسلم 128. abu
~~hurairah (may allah be pleased with him) reported: messenger of allah
~~(pbuh) said, "he who performs his wudu' perfectly and comes to jumu`ah
~~prayer and listens (to the khutbah) silently, the sins which he has
~~committed since the previous friday plus three more days (i.e., 10 days)
~~will be forgiven for him. one who distracts himself with pebbles during
~~the khutbah will not get the (jumu`ah) reward". [muslim]. commentary:
~~this hadith brings into prominence the following five important points:
~~1. it induces one to take full care in ablutions, that is to say, it
~~should be strictly performed according to sunnah. 2. the excellence of
~~jumu`ah (friday prayer), which is obligatory for every sane, adult,
~~healthy and resident muslim, whether he lives in a town or village. the
~~friday prayer is performed in the mosque in congregation. it has two
~~rak`ah at the time of noon prayer and is preceded by khutbah of imam
~~(who leads the prayer). it is not performed individually at home. 3.
~~whoever does one good act will get ten-times reward in return. according
~~to this principle, one who performs a friday prayer, his minor sins
~~relating the rights of allah which are committed by him in ten days are
~~forgiven. 4. silence during the khutbah is a must, otherwise, one loses
~~the reward of jumu`ah prayer. 5. it is also necessary for a khatib to
~~deliver a brief khutbah. PageV01P0156

# الثالث عشر عنه أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم قال : [ إذا توضأ

~~129. abu hurairah (may allah be pleased with him) reported: messenger of
~~allah (pbuh) said, "when a muslim or a believer washes his face (in the
~~course of wudu'), every sin he has committed with his eyes is washed
~~away from his face along with water, or with the last drop of water;
~~when he washes his hands, every sin they wrought is erased from his
~~hands with the water, or with the last drop of water; and when he washes
~~his feet, every sin towards which his feet walked is washed away with
~~water, or with the last drop of water, with the result that he comes out
~~cleansed of all sins". [muslim]. commentary: this hadith mentions the
~~excellence of wudu'. obviously a person who performs wudu' five times
~~daily would be free from sins. thus, wudu' is a means of both outward
~~and inward cleanliness. PageV01P0157

~~(prayers), and from one jumu`ah prayer to the (next) jumu`ah prayer, and
~~from ramadan to ramadan are expiations for the (sins) committed in
~~between (their intervals); provided the major sins are not committed".

~~does not neglect his obligations to people, then he remains free from
~~sins by means of the `ibadah (worship) stated above. PageV01P0158

# الخامس عشر عنه رضي الله عنه قال قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم : [
~~ألا أدلكم على ما يمحو الله به الخطايا ويرفع به الدرجات ؟ ] قالوا : بلى
~~يا رسول الله . قال : [ إسباغ الوضوء على المكاره وكثرة الخطا إلى المساجد
~~وانتظار الصلاة بعد الصلاة فذلكم الرباط ] رواه مسلم 131. abu hurairah
~~(may allah be pleased with him) reported: messenger of allah (pbuh)
~~said, "should i not direct you to something by which allah obliterates
~~the sins and elevates (your) ranks.'' they said: "yes, o messenger of
~~allah". he said, "performing wudu' properly, even in difficulty,
~~frequently going to the mosque, and waiting eagerly for the next salat
~~(prayer) after a salat is over; indeed, that is ar-ribat". [muslim].
~~commentary: ribat means staying on the frontier of an islamic country,
~~for security and defense purposes. thus, it is a continuous process of
~~jihad. continuous good deeds and `ibadah have been compared with ribat.
~~performing full ablution in makarih (where severe unpleasantness and
~~hard labour is involved) is quite difficult. for instance, in winter it
~~is very cumbersome to properly wash all the organs of the body but a
~~muslim does it to please allah. thus, its reward will be more in
~~proportion to the labour. similarly, the nearness of a mosque is in many
~~respect very useful but its being far from the house is better in this
~~respect that the greater distance one has to cover for going to the
~~mosque, the higher the reward for going there will be. those who live
~~close to the mosque do not have this credit. PageV01P0159

~~reported: messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "he who observes the fajr and
~~`asr (prayers) will enter jannah.'' [al-bukhari and muslim].
~~commentary: muslims are enjoined to take special care of two of the five
~~prescribed salat, namely fajr and `asr because they occur during very
~~comfortable hours. their excellence, and inducement on them, have been
~~mentioned here for the reason that there is greater possibility of
~~laziness and negligence in these two salat. it is very difficult indeed
~~to rise for salat-ul-fajr (the dawn prayer). similar is the case of
~~salat-ul-`asr (the afternoon prayer). it is the time when a person is
~~very busy in winding up his daily affairs and thus there is serious risk
~~of losing this salat on this account. one who observes these two at
~~their stated time, can easily secure the other three without much
~~effort. this endeavour on his part to secure salat will be a very
~~effective means for him to enter jannah. PageV01P0160

~~(in congregation). it was said to him (or i said to him): "if you buy a

~~according to one's intentions. if we see the matter of salat from this

~~will then be lying at his both hands. 2. everyone should spend
~~according to his capacity in the way of allah in the form of sadaqah and

# وعن أنس رضي الله عنه قال : دخل النبي صلى الله عليه و سلم المسجد فإذا
~~حبل ممدود بين الساريتين فقال : [ ما هذا الحبل ؟ ] قالوا : هذا حبل لزينب
~~فإذا فترت تعلقت به . فقال النبي صلى الله عليه و سلم : [ حلوه ليصل أحدكم
~~نشاطه فإذا فتر فليرقد ] متفق عليه 146. anas (may allah be pleased with
~~him) reported: the prophet (pbuh) came into the mosque and noticed a
~~rope stretched between two poles. he enquired, "what is this rope for?''
~~he was told: "this is zainab's rope. when during her voluntary prayer,
~~she begins to feel tired, she grasps it for support". the prophet (pbuh)
~~said, "untie it. you should perform prayers so long as you feel active.
~~when you feel tired, you should go to sleep". [al-bukhari and muslim].
~~commentary: this hadith deals with the following three points: 1. it
~~forbids undue strictness and taking support of anything in the course of
~~salat. 2. if wrong can be corrected by hand, it must be stopped
~~immediately. 3. one should be moderate in `ibadah and select such times
~~for optional and voluntary prayers when one feels real pleasure in them.

~~abu juhaifah (may allah be pleased with him) reported: the prophet
~~(pbuh) made a bond of brotherhood between salman and abud-darda'. salman
~~paid a visit to abud-darda' and found umm darda' (his wife) dressed in
~~shabby clothes and asked her why she was in that state. she replied:
~~"your brother abud-darda' is not interested in (the luxuries of) this
~~world. in the meantime abud-darda' came in and prepared a meal for
~~salman. salman requested abud-darda' to eat (with him) but abud-darda'
~~said: "i am fasting.'' salman said: "i am not going to eat unless you
~~eat.'' so, abud-darda' ate (with salman). when it was night and (a part
~~of the night passed), abud-darda' got up (to offer the night prayer) but
~~salman asked him to sleep and abud-darda' slept. after some time abud-
~~darda' again got up but salman asked him to sleep. when it was the last
~~hours of the night, salman asked him to get up and both of them offered
~~(tahajjud) prayer. then salman told abud-darda': "you owe a duty to your
~~rubb, you owe a duty to your body; you owe a duty to your family; so you
~~should give to every one his due. abud-darda' came to the prophet (pbuh)
~~and reported the whole story. prophet (pbuh) said, "salman is right".
~~[al-bukhari]. commentary: this hadith highlights the following points:
~~1. although the performance of voluntary prayers (nawafil) is highly
~~meritorious, it should not be done at the cost of obligations for, in
~~this case, they loose their merits and are disliked by allah. 2. the
~~right time for tahajjud (optional prayers at night) is the last third
~~part of the night. the reason being that in the first two portions of
~~the night, one should take rest and perform his conjugal duties. 3.
~~voluntary fasting can be broken (for valid reasons) without any
~~expiation. 4. it is permissible to establish fraternity on the basis of
~~deen, and when this is established, the families so affiliated can
~~associate with each other. 5. muslims must provide right guidance to
~~each other. 6. in case of need, it is permissible to speak to an
~~unknown woman while observing the teachings of the prophet (pbuh) in
~~this regard, such as lowering the gaze and be as brief as possible.

~~that i said that i would perform prayers the whole night and observe
~~fasting every day as long as i live. messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "is
~~it you who said this?'' i said to him, "o messenger of allah! i ransom
~~you with my parents, it is i who said that.'' messenger of allah (pbuh)
~~said, "you will not be able to do that. observe fast and break it; sleep
~~and get up for prayer, and observe fast for three days during the month;
~~for every good is multiplied ten times and that will be equal to fasting
~~the whole year.'' i said, "o messenger of allah! i can do more than
~~that.'' he said, "observe fast one day and leave off the next two
~~days.'' i said, "o messenger of allah! i have strength to do more than
~~that.'' messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "observe fast every other day,
~~and that is the fasting of dawud (pbuh) and that is the most moderate
~~fasting". according to another narration: messenger of allah (pbuh)
~~said, "that is the best fasting.'' i said, "but i am capable of doing
~~more than this". thereupon, messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "there is
~~nothing better than this.'' `abdullah bin `amr (may allah be pleased
~~with them) said (when he grew old): "had i accepted the three days
~~(fasting during every month) as the messenger of allah had said, it
~~would have been dearer to me than my family and my property". in
~~another narration `abdullah is reported to have said: messenger of allah
~~(pbuh) said to me, "o `abdullah! have i not been informed that you
~~observe fast during the day and offer prayer all the night.'' i replied,
~~"yes, o messenger of allah!'' messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "don't do
~~that. observe fast for few days and then leave off for few days, perform
~~prayers and also sleep at night, as your body has a right upon you, and
~~your eyes have a right upon you; and your wife has a right upon you;
~~your visitors have a right upon you. it is sufficient for you to observe
~~fast three days in a month, as the reward of good deeds is multiplied
~~ten times, so it will be like fasting the whole year.'' i insisted (on
~~fasting) and so i was given a hard instruction. i said, "o messenger of
~~allah! i have strength.'' messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "observe fast
~~like the fasting of prophet dawud (pbuh); and do not fast more than
~~that.'' i said: "how was the fasting of prophet dawud?'' he (pbuh) said,
~~"half of the year (i.e., he used to fast on every alternate day).''
~~afterwards when `abdullah (may allah be pleased with him) grew old, he
~~used to say: "would that i had availed myself of the concession granted
~~to me by messenger of allah.'' in another narration `abdullah is
~~reported to have said: messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "i have been
~~informed that you observe fast continuously and recite (the whole of the
~~qur'an) every night.'' i said, "messenger of allah! it is right, but i
~~covet thereby nothing but good,'' whereupon he (pbuh) said, "then
~~observe fasts like the fasting of prophet dawud (pbuh) as he was the
~~most ardent worshipper of allah; recite the qur'an once every month.'' i
~~said, "o prophet of allah! i am capable of doing more than that.'' he
~~said, "then recite it (the complete qur'an) in every twenty days.'' i
~~said, "o prophet of allah i am capable of reciting more than that.'' he
~~said, "then recite it once in every ten days.'' i said, "o prophet of
~~allah! i am capable of reciting more than that.'' he said, "then recite
~~it once in every seven days, but not recite more than that.'' the
~~prophet of allah also said to me, "you do not know, you may have a
~~longer life". when i grew old i wished i had availed myself of the
~~concession (granted to me by) the prophet of allah. in another
~~narration `abdullah is reported to have said: messenger of allah (pbuh)
~~said, "the best fasting with allah is that of (prophet) dawud, and the
~~best prayer with allah is that of dawud (pbuh) for he would sleep half
~~of the night and stand for prayer for the third of it and (then) would
~~sleep sixth part of it; he observed fast one day and leave off the
~~other. he would not flee on meeting the enemy". in another narration
~~`abdullah is reported to have said: my father helped me marry a noble
~~woman and he used to inquire of his daughter-in-law regarding her
~~husband. she would say: "he is, indeed, a fine man. since i have come to
~~him, he has neither stepped on my bed nor he has had sexual intercourse
~~with me". when this state of affairs lasted for some time, my father
~~mentioned the matter to messenger of allah (pbuh) who directed my father
~~saying, "send him to me". i went to him accordingly. he asked me, "how
~~often do you observe fast?'' i replied; "daily". he asked me, "how long
~~do you take in reading the noble qur'an completely.'' i said, "once
~~every night". then he narrated the whole story. he (in his old age)
~~would recite one seventh of his nightly recitation to some members of
~~his family during the day to lighten his task at night. whenever he
~~wished to have a relief from his fast on alternate days, he would give
~~up fasting for a few days and make up deficiency later by observing the
~~number of fasts he had missed. he would not give up the number of fasts
~~altogether because he did not like to abandon what he had settled with
~~messenger of allah (pbuh). commentary: this hadith brings the following
~~two things into focus: 1. besides mentioning the continence and ardour
~~for worship of the companions of the prophet (pbuh), it tells us of the
~~teachings of the prophet of allah to adopt moderation and fulfill the
~~lawful needs of life as well as religion. 2. it also presents a model
~~of the chastity, modesty and bashfulness of the sahabiyat (women who
~~embraced islam and saw the prophet (pbuh)). it tells how patiently they
~~bore the indifference of their husbands. in the instance quoted in the
~~above mentioned hadith, the politeness with which the wife of abdullah
~~bin `amr bin al-`as (may allah be pleased with them) answered her
~~father-in-law when he inquired her about the treatment of her husband is
~~a model of decency and modesty. PageV01P0180

~~allah be pleased with him) he said: "how are you o hanzalah?'' i said,
~~"hanzalah has become a hypocrite". he said, "far removed is allah from
~~every imperfection, what are you saying?'' i said, "when we are in the
~~company of messenger of allah (pbuh) and he reminds us of hell-fire and
~~jannah, we feel as if we are seeing them with our very eyes, and when we
~~are away from messenger of allah (pbuh), we attend to our wives, our
~~children, our business, most of these things (pertaining to life
~~hereafter) slip out of our minds.'' abu bakr (may allah be pleased with
~~him) said, "by allah, i also experience the same thing". so abu bakr
~~(may allah be pleased with him) and i went to messenger of allah (pbuh)
~~and i said to him, "o messenger of allah (pbuh), hanzalah has turned
~~hypocrite.'' thereupon messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "what has
~~happened to you?'' i said, "o messenger of allah, when we are in your
~~company, and are reminded of hell-fire and jannah, we feel as if we are
~~seeing them with our own eyes, but when we go away from you and attend
~~to our wives, children and business, much of these things go out of our
~~minds.'' thereupon messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "by him in whose hand
~~is my life if your state of mind remains the same as it is in my
~~presence and you are always busy in remembrance (of allah), the angels
~~will shake hands with you in your beds and in your roads; but hanzalah,
~~time should be devoted (to the worldly affairs) and time should be
~~devoted (to prayer)". he (the prophet (pbuh)) said this thrice.
~~[muslim]. commentary: this hadith also tells us about the continence
~~and piety of the companions of the prophet (pbuh) with reference to the
~~natural instinct of man to think differently in different situations.
~~this condition has nothing to do with nifaq (hypocrisy). islam is the
~~deen of fitrah (pure nature) and takes the middle course in everything,

~~so he asked about him and was told that he was abu israel who had taken
~~a vow to remain standing and not sit, or go into the shade, or speak
~~while observing fasting. thereupon messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "tell
~~him to speak, to go into the shade, to sit and to complete his fast''.
~~[al-bukhari]. commentary: 1. this hadith makes it abundantly clear that

~~methods. it can only be achieved by ways and means prescribed in the
~~qur'an and sunnah. 2. one should never vow for anything which is
~~smeared with sin or which is not permitted by deen. an instance of this

~~khutbah on account of which eyes shed tears and hearts were full of
~~tears. a man said: "o prophet of allah, this is as if it were a parting
~~advice. so advise us". he (pbuh) said, "i admonish you to fear allah, to
~~listen and obey even if an abyssinian slave is appointed as your leader.
~~because whosoever among you shall live after me, will see much discord.
~~so hold fast to my sunnah and the examples of the rightly-guided caliphs
~~who will come after me. adhere to them and hold to it fast. beware of

~~and at-tirmidhi]. commentary: this hadith stresses piety, obedience to
~~the leader, following in the footsteps of the prophet (pbuh) and the
~~first four noble caliphs. it strictly forbids innovation in deen. this
~~hadith also reveals the prediction of the prophet (pbuh) that the muslim
~~ummah will become a victim of dissension. he also prescribed the right
~~means to counteract it. the remedy that he has proposed for this problem
~~is that muslims should never deviate from the path laid for them by him
~~and his righteous successors. this is the touchstone for discovering the

~~messenger of allah (pbuh) with his left hand. he (pbuh) said, "eat with
~~your right hand". he said, "i cannot do that.'' thereupon he (the
~~prophet) said, "may you never do that.'' it was pride that prevented him
~~from doing it. and he could not raise it (the right hand) up to his
~~mouth afterwards. [muslim]. commentary: 1. to eat with the left hand

~~messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "the similitude of guidance and
~~knowledge with which allah has sent me is like a rain which has fallen
~~on some ground. a fertile part of earth has absorbed water and brought
~~forth much grass and herbs. another part, which is solid, held the water
~~and allah benefits men thereby, who drank and gave others to drink, and
~~used it for irrigation. but some of it has fallen on a portion of sandy
~~land which neither retains the water nor produces herbage. such is the
~~likeness of the man who understands the religion of allah and who gets
~~benefit of what allah has sent me with; he learns and teaches others. it
~~is also the likeness of the man who neither raises his head on that
~~account (meaning he does not benefit from what the prophet (pbuh) was
~~sent with) nor accepts allah's guidance with which i am sent". [al-
~~bukhari and muslim]. commentary: in this hadith the guidance and
~~knowledge which was sent to mankind through the prophet (pbuh) is
~~compared to the rain which is beneficial, because this knowledge
~~resuscitates the dead hearts as does the rain to a barren land. one who
~~makes use of this knowledge is likened to a good soil, and one who
~~acquires this knowledge and imparts it to others but does not put it
~~into practice is considered akin to a hard land which holds water and
~~other people utilize it. a person who neither learns it nor acts upon it
~~is like a desolate land which neither holds water nor produces anything.
~~such a person is the worst of all because he neither himself benefits
~~from it nor lets others make use of it. this hadith induces one to
~~acquire knowledge, impart it to others, put it into actual practice and
~~warns people from neglecting this duty. PageV01P0196

~~fingers (after eating) and the cleaning of the dish, saying: "you do not
~~know in what portion the blessing (of allah) lies". [muslim]. in
~~another narration, jabir said: messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "when a
~~morsel of any of you falls down, you should pick it up and remove any
~~dirt or dust on it and then eat it; and don't leave it for satan; and do
~~not wipe your hand with the towel until you have licked your fingers,
~~for you do not know in what portion of the food the barakah* (of allah)
~~lies". * barakah is the abundance of goodness and its continuity.
~~commentary: this hadith enjoins muslims to lick their fingers after
~~meals, wipe off the food left in the utensils and eat morsels which fall
~~down in the course of eating. all these things have many advantages: 1.
~~may be that is the blessed portion of the food which sticks to the
~~fingers or utensils. 2. this practice is a sign of humility and
~~aversion from the style of proud and haughty people. 3. it saves one
~~from being ungrateful to allah. 4. by these means one defeats satan.
~~in the light of these islamic injunctions one can very well judge
~~violation of islamic teachings and ungratefulness to allah which is

~~you had left them.' i shall then say as the righteous slave [i.e., `isa

~~you forgive them, verily, you, only you are the all-mighty, the all-

~~he wanted to make it absolutely clear to the illiterate and ignorant
~~that al-hajar al-aswad (black stone of the ka`bah) is not kissed for
~~because stones are venerated in islam, as was the practice in pre-
~~islamic period. what he wanted to emphasize was that kissing the black
~~stone was in accordance with the sunnah of the prophet (pbuh). 2.

~~understands the wisdom behind it or not. by analogy, kissing of the
~~black stone, some people think it is permissible to kiss and show

~~revealed to you and it is beyond our power to live up to it.'' messenger
~~of allah (pbuh) said, "do you want to say what the people of two books
~~(jews and christians) said before you: 'we hear and disobey?' you should
~~rather say: 'we hear and we obey, we seek forgiveness, our rubb and unto
~~you is the return.''' and they said: "we hear and we obey, (we seek)
~~your forgiveness, our rubb! and unto you is the return.'' when the
~~people recited it and it smoothly flowed on their tongues, then allah
~~revealed immediately afterwards: "the messenger (muhammad (pbuh))
~~believes in what has been sent down to him from his rubb, and (so do)
~~the believers. each one believes in allah, his angels, his books, and
~~his messengers. (they say), 'we make no distinction between one another
~~of his messengers' - and they say, 'we hear, and we obey. (we seek) your
~~forgiveness, our rubb, and to you is the return (of all)". when they did
~~that, allah abrogated this (ayah) and allah the great revealed: "allah
~~burdens not a person beyond his scope. he gets reward for that (good)
~~which he has earned, and he is punished for that (evil) which he has
~~earned.'' (the prophet (pbuh) said): "yes. 'our rubb! lay not on us a
~~burden like that which you did lay on those before us (jews and
~~christians)". (the prophet (pbuh) said): "yes. 'our rubb! put not on us
~~a burden greater than we have strength to bear". (the prophet (pbuh)
~~said): "yes. 'pardon us and grant us forgiveness. have mercy on us. you
~~are our maula (patron, supporter and protector) and give us victory over
~~the disbelieving people". he (the prophet (pbuh)) said: "yes".
~~[muslim]. commentary: we learn from this hadith that initially every
~~person was answerable for thoughts and doubts even those which crossed
~~his mind; something on which nobody had any control. the companions of
~~the prophet (pbuh) were naturally disturbed on this situation. but when
~~they heard and obeyed the orders of the prophet (pbuh) then almighty
~~allah revoked this order with the elaboration that he does not put
~~anyone to trouble beyond his capacity. it is, therefore, essential for
~~every muslim to obey all the injunctions of allah because none of it is
~~such that he is unable to carry out. PageV01P0204

~~أحدث في أمرنا هذا ما ليس منه فهو رد ] متفق عليه وفي رواية لمسلم [ من عمل
~~عملا ليس عليه أمرنا فهو رد ] 169. `aishah (may allah be pleased with
~~her) reported: messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "if anyone introduces in
~~our matter something which does not belong to it, will be rejected".
~~[al-bukhari and muslim]. the narration in muslim says: "if anybody
~~introduces a practice which is not authenticated by me, it is to be
~~rejected". commentary: this hadith lays down a very important
~~principle. unfortunately, muslims have not attached any importance to
~~this hadith and the principle given in it with the result that
~~innovations in the deen have become so common that they have been taken
~~for true deen; our people act upon them and are made to practice them.
~~one reason for this is their lack of education and ignorance about deen.
~~the second reason is their lack of understanding of the principle
~~prescribed in this hadith although it is stated in very explicit terms.
~~the principle that we learn from this hadith is that every such action
~~or activity is innovation which is done as a virtue and to gain the
~~pleasure of allah but is not consonant with the teachings of the qur'an
~~and sunnah, or which does not agree with the interpretation of the nuss
~~(text) given by the companions of the prophet (pbuh) or their successors
~~(tabi`un). the reason being that the period of the companions and the
~~tabi`un is the khair-ul-qurun (the best of all generations). thus any
~~action or activity that is deprived of the support of these generations
~~falls in the category of heresies. PageV01P0207

~~ويقول : [ بعثت أنا والساعة كهاتين ] ويقرن بين أصبعيه السبابة والوسطى
~~ويقول : [ أما بعد فإن خير الحديث كتاب الله وخير الهدي هدي محمد صلى الله
~~عليه و سلم وشر الأمور محدثاتها وكل بدعة ضلالة ] ثم يقول : [ أنا أولى بكل
~~مؤمن من نفسه : من ترك مالا فلأهله ومن ترك دينا أو ضياعا فإلي وعلي ] رواه
~~مسلم وعن العرباض بن سارية رضي الله عنه حديثه السابق ( انظر الحديث رقم
~~157 ) في باب المحافظة على السنة 170. jabir (may allah be pleased with
~~him) reported: whenever the messenger of allah (pbuh) delivered a
~~khutbah, his eyes would become red, his tone loud and he showed anger as
~~if he were warning us against an army. he (pbuh) would say, "the enemy
~~is about to attack you in the morning and the enemy is advancing against
~~you in the evening". he would further say, "i am sent with the final
~~hour like these two fingers of mine.'' messenger of allah (pbuh) held up
~~his index finger and the middle finger together to illustrate. he used
~~to add: "to proceed, the best speech is the book of allah and the best
~~guidance is the guidance of muhammad (pbuh), the worst practice is the
~~introduction of new practices in islam and every bid`ah is a
~~misguidance". he would also say, "i am, in respect of rights, nearer to
~~every believer than his own self. he who leaves an estate, it belongs to
~~his heirs, and he who leaves a debt, it is my responsibility to pay it
~~off.'' [muslim]. same hadith as reported by `irbad bin sariyah (may

~~chapter regarding safeguarding the sunnah of the prophet (pbuh). (see
~~hadith number 158) commentary: 1. this hadith mentions the style of the
~~speech of the prophet (pbuh). his auspicious presence is regarded in it
~~as a sign of the nearness of the day of resurrection. 2. it emphasizes
~~the importance of the qur'an and the sunnah and brings into focus the
~~destruction caused by bid`ah in deen. 3. it clearly lays down that the
~~orphans and the needy are the liability of the government/bait-ul-mal
~~(public exchequer). the reason being that the caliphs were the
~~successors of the prophet (pbuh) and the work which was done by him in

~~وبعد الألف باء موحدة 171. jarir bin `abdullah (may allah be pleased with

~~when there came to him some people clad in woollen rags, or covered with
~~sleeveless blankets; and with swords hanging down from their necks. most
~~of them rather, all of them, belonged to the mudar tribe. the face of
~~the prophet (pbuh) changed when he saw them starving. then he went into
~~his house and came out; then he commanded bilal (may allah be pleased
~~with him) to proclaim adhan (call to prayers). so he proclaimed adhan
~~and recited iqamah and the prophet (pbuh) led the salat. then he
~~delivered a khutbah saying, "o mankind! be dutiful to your rubb, who
~~created you from a single person (adam), and from him (adam) he created
~~his wife (eve), and from them both he created many men and women; and
~~fear allah through whom you demand your (natural) rights, and do not
~~sever the relations of kinship. surely, allah is ever an all-watcher
~~over you.'' (4:1) he also recited the ayah which is in the end of surat
~~al-hashr: "o you who believe! fear allah and keep your duty to him. and
~~let every one look what he has sent forth for the tomorrow". (59:18).
~~thereafter, every man gave in charity dinar, dirham, clothes, measure-
~~fulls of wheat and measure-fulls of dates till he said: "(give in
~~charity) be it half a date". then a man of the ansar came with a bag
~~which was difficult for him to hold in his hand. thereafter, the people
~~came successively (with charity) till i saw two heaps of food and
~~clothes. i noticed that the face of messenger of allah (pbuh) was
~~glowing like that of the bright moon or glittering gold. then he (pbuh)
~~said, "whosoever introduces a good practice in islam, there is for him
~~its reward and the reward of those who act upon it after him without
~~anything being diminished from their rewards. and whosoever introduces
~~an evil practice in islam, will shoulder its sin and the sins of all
~~those who will act upon it, without diminishing in any way their burden"
~~[muslim]. commentary: 1. some people try to deduce a proof for good
~~innovations from the words: "mun sana' fi al- islam sunah hasanah".
~~whosoever introduces a good practice in islam. thus they classify
~~innovations bid`ah into two categories, namely good innovations and bad
~~innovations. but this is wrong. no innovation can be good. it is always
~~bad because it amounts to inventing shar`iah which no one has the right
~~to do. constitution of shar`iah is the exclusive right of allah alone.
~~it is he who constitutes the shar`iah and it is on his behest that his
~~prophets convey it to the people. not to speak of scholars and others.
~~2. what this hadith makes abundantly clear is that anyone who tries to
~~find new ways and means to preach and practice islamic shar`iah, which
~~are later on adopted by other people also, would not only get the reward
~~of doing so but he will also be rewarded for the endeavours of those who
~~will after him continue them and perform good deeds. but anything of
~~which we do not find any trace in shar`iah is bad. it cannot be good in
~~any case, no matter what means are adopted for this purpose. 3. other
~~benefits of this hadith are self-evident and do not need further
~~elaboration. [ النمار ] جمع نمرة وهي كساء من صوف مخطط ومعنى [ مجتابيها ]

~~actually gone for jihad); and he who looks after the family of a warrior
~~in the way of allah will get the reward of the one who has gone for
~~jihad". [al-bukhari and muslim]. commentary: this hadith tells the mode
~~which can make jihad more effective and give the participants of jihad
~~equal share in its reward. every society has many able-bodied young
~~people who want to take part in jihad but do not have the resources for
~~it, and this is how a very useful segment of the society fails to make

~~and youth which are essential for jihad. according to the method
~~prescribed in this hadith, not only the requisite manpower and resources
~~essential for jihad are combined but everyone gets an even share in its
~~reward. it should be kept in mind that in the early period of islam,
~~mujahidun (the muslims who took part in jihad) were neither professional
~~soldiers nor were they paid regular salaries, the way they now

~~قال : [ الخازن المسلم الأمين الذي ينفذ ما أمر به فيعطيه كاملا موفرا طيبة
~~به نفسه فيدفعه إلى الذي أمر له به أحد المتصدقين ] متفق عليه وفي رواية :
~~[ الذي يعطي ما أمر به ] وضبطوا [ المتصدقين ] بفتح القاف مع كسر النون على
~~التثنية وعكسه على الجمع وكلاهما صحيح 180. abu musa (may allah be pleased
~~with him) reported: the prophet (pbuh) said, "the honest muslim trustee
~~who carries out duties assigned to him (in another narration he said,
~~"who gives''), and he gives that in full, with his heart overflowing
~~with cheerfulness, to whom he is ordered, he is one of the two givers of
~~charity". [al-bukhari and muslim]. commentary: this hadith also
~~mentions a very important principle to the effect that everyone must
~~wholeheartedly perform the duty assigned to him by the state. if he is
~~appointed custodian of the bait-ul-mal (public exchequer), he must
~~fulfill his duty with utmost honesty. if he is not envious of anyone,
~~nor harms anybody, nor behaves niggardly then he will be entitled to the
~~same reward which will be due to the person who entrusted him that duty.
~~thus this hadith enjoins every muslim to perform his official duties
~~wholeheartedly and to the best of his ability. PageV01P0224

~~ولرسوله ولأئمة المسلمين وعامتهم ] رواه مسلم 181. tamim bin aus ad-dari
~~(may allah be pleased with him) reported: the prophet (pbuh) said, "ad-
~~deen is sincerity". we said: "for whom?'' he replied, "for allah, his
~~book, his messenger and for the leaders of the muslims and their
~~masses". [muslim]. commentary: this hadith stresses the importance and
~~merits of general sincerity. sincerity for allah here means that one
~~must have true faith in him and he should be worshipped with full
~~devotion and sincerity. sincerity for the qur'an means that one should
~~confirm its truth with one's full heart and mind, recite it regularly,
~~act upon the injunctions contained in it with meticulous care and
~~strictly avoid its misinterpretation. sincerity of the prophet (pbuh)
~~means sincere confirmation of his prophethood, faithful obedience of his
~~orders and adherence to his sunnah. the goodwill of the muslim rulers
~~stands here for co-operating with them in their lawful orders and
~~obedience of their such orders which are free from any trace of sin. if
~~they deviate from the straight path they should be persuaded to turn to
~~virtue. one should not revolt against them unless they commit
~~infidelity. the goodwill of the muslim masses means that one should work
~~for the betterment of their life in this world and the hereafter. they
~~should be provided the right guidance, induced to perform good deeds and
~~deterred from evils. PageV01P0227

~~hadith about the importance and virtue of mutual love among the muslims.
~~if we act upon the injunctions mentioned in this hadith, the muslim
~~societies will be immediately purged of the evils like exploitation,

~~similarly, it is not permissible to revolt against them until they

~~remain safe". [al-bukhari]. commentary: we learn from this hadith that
~~the consequences of committing acts which are forbidden in islam are not
~~confined only to those persons who commit them, but the whole society
~~has to suffer for them. it is, therefore, essential that the people who
~~are in the habit of committing sinful acts and violate divine

~~the prophet (pbuh) said, "you will have rulers some of whom you approve
~~and some of whom you will disapprove. he who dislikes them will be safe,
~~and he who expresses disapproval will be safe, but he who is pleased and
~~follows them (will be indeed sinful)". his audience asked: "shall we not
~~fight them?'' he replied, "no, as long as they establish salat amongst
~~you". [muslim]. commentary: 1. by qualifying the obedience of muslim
~~rulers with salat, it has been made clear that what actually
~~distinguishes between kufr and islam is salat. 2. if a person has the
~~power to stop the rulers from committing evil deeds, he must use this
~~power for it. if he is incapable of it, he should at least condemn their
~~evil deeds in his heart. to join or acquiesce in the evil deeds of the
~~rulers is an extremely dangerous trend. from this angle, participation

~~"to lower your gaze (on seeing what is illegal to look at), and (removal
~~of harmful objects), returning greetings, enjoining good and forbidding

~~that it is improper to sit on roadsides and passages in such a way which
~~causes inconvenience to men and women who pass by. it is really very
~~unfortunate that now we do not care about such things at all. 2. if
~~sitting on roadside is indispensable at all, then it is essential to

~~ring is prohibited for men and so is wearing of golden ornament by them.
~~it is very unfortunate indeed that nowadays it has become a popular
~~fashion to present men gold ring on their marriage and they wear it with
~~great pride. it is a very dangerous custom and must be altogether
~~shunned for two reasons. firstly, it is an unnecessary formality and
~~burden to exchange presents and hold big feasts on betrothal ceremony.
~~it is also open to objection in islamic law. secondly, to give and take

~~and had they believed in allah and in the prophet (muhammad (pbuh)) and
~~in what has been revealed to him, never would they have taken them (the
~~disbelievers) as auliya' (protectors and helpers); but many of them are
~~the fasiqun (rebellious, disobedient to allah).'' (5:78-81) then he
~~(pbuh) continued: "nay, by allah, you either enjoin good and forbid evil
~~and catch hold of the hand of the oppressor and persuade him to act
~~justly and stick to the truth, or, allah will involve the hearts of some
~~of you with the hearts of others and will curse you as he had cursed
~~them". [abu dawud and at-tirmidhi]. the wording in at-tirmidhi is:
~~messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "when the children of israel became
~~sinful, their learned men prohibited them but they would not turn back.
~~yet, the learned men associated with them and ate and drank with them.
~~so, they were cursed at the tongues of dawud and `isa (jesus), son of
~~maryam (mary), because they were disobedient and were given to
~~transgression.'' at this stage messenger of allah (pbuh) who was
~~reclining on a pillow sat up and said, "no, by him in whose hand my soul
~~is, there is no escape for you but you persuade them to act justly.''
~~commentary: this hadith tells us that the duty of `ulama' is to check
~~the people from vice and if, in spite of all their efforts people do not
~~abandon them, they should avoid associating with them because it is a
~~matter of religious reverence and vanity. if they do not do it, they
~~will also be cursed like the disobedient lot. may allah save us from

# الرابع عشر عن أبي بكر الصديق رضي الله عنه قال : يا أيها الناس إنكم
~~لتقرؤون هذه الآية : { يا أيها الذين آمنوا عليكم أنفسكم لا يضركم من ضل
~~إذا اهتديتم } ( المائدة 105 ) وإني سمعت رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم
~~يقول : [ إن الناس إذا رأوا الظالم فلم يأخذوا على يديه أوشك أن يعمهم الله
~~بعقاب منه ] رواه أبو داود والترمذي والنسائي بأسانيد صحيحة 197. abu bakr
~~as-siddiq (may allah bepleased with him) reported: "o you people! you
~~recite this verse: `o you who believe! take care of your ownselves. if
~~you follow the (right) guidance [and enjoin what is right (islamic
~~monotheism and all that islam orders one to do) and forbid what is wrong
~~(polytheism, disbelief and all that islam has forbidden)] no hurt can
~~come to you from those who are in error.' (5:105) but i have heard
~~messenger of allah (pbuh) saying: "when people see an oppressor but do
~~not prevent him from (doing evil), it is likely that allah will punish
~~them all.'' [abu dawud and at-tirmidhi]. commentary: what abu bakr as-
~~siddiq (may allah bepleased with him) had stated was that the ayah
~~mentioned in this hadith was generally understood to mean that if a
~~person is on the straight path then it is not necessary for him to
~~preach virtue and forbid vice because in that case he neither has the
~~fear of being harmed by the disobedience and sins of others nor is he
~~answerable to allah for their misdeeds. thus, what it implies is that
~~muslim ummah is not responsible for the enforcement of islamic shari`ah
~~in the world and all it is concerned with is its own improvement only.
~~by narrating this hadith, abu bakr as-siddiq (may allah bepleased with
~~him) refuted this interpretation of the ayah and made it clear that it
~~is the duty of the ummah and each of its member to make best possible
~~efforts to check the vices prevalent in the society. so much so that if
~~a muslim has the ability to check the vices by means of force or speech
~~but he does not do it, his negligence in this regard will become a cause
~~of divine wrath and punishment. the true significance of this ayah is
~~that if, in spite of the best efforts on the part of the pious ones
~~there is no improvement, and people do not abstain from sins and
~~disobedience of allah, then the pious persons will not be held
~~responsible for what the defaulters do, nor would they suffer on this
~~account. this interpretation of the ¢yah removes the conflict that seems
~~to exist between the meaning of the ayah and the hadith PageV01P0245

~~innermost (root) of the hearts of men (that is, it was in their heart
~~innately, by fitrah, or pure human nature). then the qur'an was revealed
~~and they learnt from the quran and they learned from the sunnah.'' then
~~the (prophet (pbuh)) told us about the removal of amanah. he said, "the

~~would be taken away from his heart leaving an impression of a blister,

~~then took up a pebble and rolled it over his foot and said, "the people
~~would enter into transactions with one another and hardly a person would
~~be left who would return (things) entrusted to him (and there would look
~~like an honest person) till it would be said: `in such and such tribe
~~there is a trustworthy man.' and they would also say about a person:

~~either a wrongdoer or a wronged one. i expect that i shall be the the
~~wronged one today. i am much worried about my debt. do you think that
~~anything will be left over from our property after the payment of my
~~debt? my son, sell our property and pay off my debt.'' az-zubair then
~~willed one-third of that portion to his sons; namely `abdullah's sons.
~~he said, "one-third of the one-third. if any property is left after the
~~payment of debts, one-third (of the one-third of what is left is to be
~~given to your sons.'' (hisham, a subnarrator added: "some of the sons of
~~`abdullah were equal in age to the sons of az-zubair, e.g., khubaib and
~~abbad. `abdullah had nine sons and nine daughters at that time)". (the
~~narrator `abdullah added:) he kept on instructing me about his debts and
~~then said: "my son, should you find yourself unable to pay any portion
~~of my debt then beseech my master for his help.'' by allah, i did not
~~understand what he meant and asked: "father, who is your master?'' he
~~said: "allah.'' by allah! whenever i faced a difficulty in discharging
~~any portion of his debt; i would pray: "o master of zubair, discharge
~~his debt,'' and he discharged it. zubair was martyred. he left no money,
~~but he left certain lands, one of them in al-ghabah, eleven houses in
~~al-madinah, two in basrah, one in kufah and one in egypt. the cause of
~~his indebtedness was that a person would come to him asking him to keep
~~some money of his in trust for him. zubair would refuse to accept it as
~~a trust, fearing it might be lost, but would take it as a loan. he never
~~accepted a governorship, or revenue office, or any public office. he
~~fought along with messenger of allah (pbuh) and abu bakr, `umar and
~~`uthman (may allah be pleased with them). `abdullah added: i prepared a
~~statement of his debts and they amounted to two million and two hundred
~~thousand! hakim bin hizam met me and asked me: "nephew, how much is due
~~from my brother as debt?'' i kept it as secret and said: "a hundred
~~thousand.'' hakim said: "by allah! i do not think your assets are
~~sufficient for the payment of these debts.'' i said: "what would you
~~think if the amount were two million and two hundred thousand?'' he
~~said: "i do not think that you would be able to clear off the debts. if
~~you find it difficult let me know.'' az-zubair (may allah bepleased
~~with him) had purchased the land in al-ghabah for a hundred and seventy
~~thousand. `abdullah sold it for a million and six hundred thousand, and
~~declared that whosoever had a claim against az-zubair (may allah
~~bepleased with him) should see him in al-ghabah. `abdullah bin ja`far
~~(may allah bepleased with him) came to him and said: "az-zubair (may
~~allah bepleased with him) owed me four hundred thousand, but i would
~~remit the debt if you wish.'' `abdullah (may allah bepleased with him)
~~said: "no.'' ibn ja`far said: ``if you would desire for postponement i
~~would postpone the recovery of it.'' `abdullah said: "no.'' ibn ja`far
~~then said: "in that case, measure out a plot for me.'' `abdullah marked
~~out a plot. thus he sold the land and discharged his father's debt.
~~there remained out of the land four and a half shares. he then visited
~~mu`awiyah who had with him at the time `amr bin `uthman, al-mundhir bin
~~az-zubair and ibn zam`ah (may allah bepleased with them). mu`awiyah (may
~~allah bepleased with him) said: "what price did you put on the land in
~~al-ghabah?'' he said: "one hundred thousand for a each share. mu`awiyah
~~inquired: "how much of it is left?'' `abdullah said: "four and a half
~~shares.'' al-mundhir bin az-zubair said: "i will buy one share for a
~~hundred thousand". `amr bin `uthman said: "i will buy one share for a
~~hundred thousand". ibn zam`ah said: "i will buy one share for a hundred
~~thousand.'' then mu`awiyah asked: "how much of it is now left?''
~~`abdullah said: "one and a half share. mu`awiyah said: "i will take it
~~for one hundred and fifty thousand.'' later `abdullah bin ja`far sold
~~his share to mu`awiyah for six hundred thousand. when `abdullah bin az-
~~zubair (may allah bepleased with him) finished the debts, the heirs of
~~az-zubair (may allah bepleased with him) asked him to distribute the
~~inheritance among them. he said: "i will not do that until i announce
~~during four successive hajj seasons: `let he who has a claim against az-
~~zubair come forward and we shall discharge it.''' he made this
~~declaration on four hajj seasons and then distributed the inheritance
~~among the heirs of az-zubair (may allah bepleased with him) according to
~~his will. az-zubair (may allah bepleased with him) had four wives. each
~~of them received a million and two hundred thousand. thus az-zubair's
~~total property was amounted to fifty million and two hundred thousand.

~~the farewell pilgrimage without knowing what was it when messenger of
~~allah (pbuh) was also present. he (pbuh) stood up and recited the praise
~~and glorification of allah. he then gave a detailed account of ad-dajjal
~~and said, 'every prophet sent by allah had warned his people against his
~~mischief. nuh (pbuh) )warned his nation and so did all the prophets
~~after him. if he (i.e., ad-dajjal) appears among you, his condition will
~~not remain hidden from you. your rubb is not one-eyed, but ad-dajjal is.

~~this month of yours (i.e., dhul -hijjah). listen, have i conveyed
~~allah's message to you?'' the people replied in affirmative. there upon
~~he said, "o allah, bear witness.'' and he repeated it thrice. he (pbuh)
~~concluded: "do not revert after me as infidels killing one another".
~~[al-bukhari]. commentary: this hadith brings out the following three
~~points: 1. some marks and signs of pseudo-messiah (al-masih ad-dajjal)
~~are mentioned to warn the believers against his mischief. 2. the lives
~~and properties of muslims are inviolable for each other. in other words,
~~it means that each of them is a protector and guardian of the life,
~~property and honour of the other. 3. internal war among the muslims is
~~a great crime and can even lead to infidelity (kufr). may allah save us
~~all from it. PageV01P0259

~~three of them consecutive - dhul-qa`dah, dhul-hijjah and muharram and

~~said: "allah and his messenger know better.'' he (pbuh) remained silent
~~until we thought that he would give it another name. he asked, "is it
~~not the day of an-nahr (the sacrifice)?". we replied in the affirmative.
~~thereupon he said, "your blood, your property and your honour are
~~inviolable to you all like the inviolablity of this day of yours, in
~~this city of yours and in this month of yours. you will soon meet your
~~rubb and he will ask you about your deeds. so do not turn to disbelief
~~after me by striking the necks of one another. behold! let him who is
~~present here convey (this message ) to him who is absent; for many a

~~one who hears it.'' he (pbuh) again said, "have i conveyed the message
~~to you? behold! have i conveyed the commandments (of allah) to you.'' we
~~submitted: "yes". he then said, "o allah, bear witness (to this)". [al-
~~bukhari and muslim]. commentary: 1. the cycle of years and months (that
~~is to say a month consists of 30 or 29 days and a year has 12 months)
~~was completed at the time of creation of heavens and earth. 2. the
~~hadith mentions the sanctity of life, property, respect and honour of
~~each muslim for the other and lays stress upon the importance of this
~~bond in them. 3. it reminds that everyone will be answerable for his
~~actions on the day of requittal. 4. it urges that one should not just

~~explained through this hadith that he, too, was a man like others and

~~believer is like (the bricks of) a building, each strengthens the

~~the congregational prayer, is enjoined to shorten the prayer in
~~consideration of those who pray behind him. shortening of prayer here
~~means that the surah of the qur'an recited by him in the prayer should
~~not be very long. this does not mean, however, that the postures of
~~salat, such as standing, bowing, prostration and sitting should not be
~~done properly, as it is taken to mean by muslims in general. although it

~~be taken to mean here: "i am not a human like you''. what they really
~~mean is that no one else has that special contact with allah which he
~~has. on account of this quality which was special to the prophet (pbuh),

~~commentary: in this hadith, brevity of prayers stands for recitation of
~~short surah of the noble qur'an in prescribed congregational prayers.
~~the sahih muslim has elucidated this by saying that the prophet (pbuh)
~~would recite short surah on hearing the crying of a baby. in short, this

~~because, he will get hold of him and throw him down on his face in the

~~prayer is in the nature of an agreement between allah and his slave
~~(muslim). it tells us that he would not all day long depart from the way
~~of allah as he has not done by performing his fajr prayer. he will not
~~only perform all the other prescribed prayers but would also do nothing

~~liable to a punishment of fifty stripes, and this punishment can be
~~given by her master. this hadith is, in fact addressed to the master of
~~such a slave-girl. the order that one should not censure and reproach

~~punishment is fixed for drinking take support from this hadith. they
~~hold that its punishment is discretionary which can be increased or
~~decreased according to the circumstances. but other learned men who hold
~~that its hadd is forty stripes argue that the incident quoted in this
~~hadith relates to the period when its hadd had not been fixed. when the
~~prophet (pbuh) ordered the punishment of forty stripes for it then it
~~became its prescribed hadd. abu bakr (may allah bepleased with him)
~~followed it during the period of his caliphate. `umar (may allah

~~but subsequently raised its punishment to eighty stripes. the `ulama'
~~who maintain the punishment of forty stripes contend that the original
~~hadd was forty stripes and the additional forty stripes comprised
~~discretionary punishment for which the head of a state has full
~~authority. if he feels, he can add discretionary punishment to the hadd.
~~the nature of this additional punishment depends on his discretion. the
~~latter opinion seems to be more correct that hadd is fixed for drinking

# وعن ابن عمر رضي الله عنه أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم قال : [
~~المسلم أخو المسلم : لا يظلمه ولا يسلمه . من كان في حاجة أخيه كان الله في
~~حاجته ومن فرج عن مسلم كربة فرج الله عنه بها كربة من كرب يوم القيامة ومن
~~ستر مسلما ستره الله يوم القيامة ] متفق عليه 244. ibn `umar (may allah
~~bepleased with them) reported: messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "a muslim
~~is a brother of (another) muslim, he neither wrongs him nor does hand
~~him over to one who does him wrong. if anyone fulfills his brother's
~~needs, allah will fulfill his needs; if one relieves a muslim of his
~~troubles, allah will relieve his troubles on the day of resurrection;
~~and if anyone covers up a muslim (his sins), allah will cover him up
~~(his sins) on the resurrection day". [al-bukhari and muslim].
~~commentary: this hadith tells us that we should fulfill the needs of
~~muslims for the pleasure of allah only, regardless of any vested
~~interest or worldly motive. it is a very meritorious approach. the needs
~~of people who adopt this attitude in life are fulfilled by allah, and
~~the reward they get for it in the hereafter will be greater than that to
~~be given in this world. PageV01P0304
# 245. abu hurairah (may allah bepleased with him) reported: the prophet
~~(pbuh) said, "he who removes from a believer one of his difficulties of
~~this world, allah will remove one of his troubles on the day of
~~resurrection; and he who finds relief for a hard-pressed person, allah
~~will make things easy for him on the day of resurrection; he who covers
~~up (the faults and sins) of a muslim, allah will cover up (his faults
~~and sins) in this world and in the hereafter. allah supports his slave
~~as long as the slave is supportive of his brother; and he who treads the
~~path in search of knowledge, allah makes that path easy, leading to
~~jannah for him; the people who assemble in one of the houses of allah,
~~reciting the book of allah, learning it and teaching, there descends
~~upon them the tranquillity, and mercy covers them, the angels flock
~~around them, and allah mentions them in the presence of those near him;
~~and he who lags behind in doing good deeds, his noble lineage will not
~~make him go ahead.'' [muslim] commentary: besides other advantages
~~mentioned in this hadith, we learn the following from it: 1. it is an
~~act of great merit to relieve a muslim from his financial difficulty.
~~2. to strive for attaining religious knowledge is a highly meritorious
~~act. 3. to recite the noble qur'an, make arrangement for its study and
~~teaching, and hold meetings for the understanding and elucidation of the
~~message of the noble qur'an are acts of great distinction and reward.

# وعن ابن عباس رضي الله عنه في قصة بريرة وزوجها قال قال لها النبي صلى
~~الله عليه و سلم : [ لو راجعته ؟ ] قالت : يا رسول الله تأمرني ؟ قال : [
~~إنما أشفع ] قالت : لا حاجة لي فيه . رواه البخاري 247. ibn `abbas (may
~~allah bepleased with them), reported in connection with the case of
~~barirah (may allah bepleased with her) and her husband: the prophet
~~(pbuh) said to her, "it is better for you to go back to your husband.''
~~she asked: "o messenger of allah, do you order me to do so.'' he
~~replied, "i only intercede'' she then said: "i have no need for him".
~~[al-bukhari]. commentary: barirah (may allah bepleased with her) was a
~~slave-girl of `aishah (may allah bepleased with her). barirah was
~~married to a slave named mughith (may allah bepleased with him). she was
~~freed by `aishah (may allah bepleased with her). now, islam has
~~permitted a slave-girl that after being freed, she can break her
~~matrimonial bond if she does not like to live with her husband. mughith
~~was madly in love with her and he would all the time persuade her not to
~~break their bond of marriage. when the prophet (pbuh) came to know the
~~condition of mughith, he interceded for him and asked barirah to restore
~~her matrimonial connection with her husband. since this was an advice
~~and recommendation, she did not think it suitable for herself and
~~regretted that she could not accept it. the hadith evidently shows that
~~islam accepts legitimate rights of individuals and honours personal
~~freedom, provided they do not exceed the limits of shari`ah. this
~~freedom cannot be forfeited by suppression or force. PageV01P0309

~~والكلمة الطيبة صدقة وبكل خطوة تمشيها إلى الصلاة صدقة وتميط الأذى عن

~~abu hurairah (may allah be pleased with him) reported: messenger of
~~allah (pbuh) said, "on every joint of man, there is charity, on everyday
~~when the sun rises: doing justice between two men is charity, and
~~assisting a man to ride an animal or to load his luggage on it is
~~charity; and a good word is charity, every step which one takes towards
~~(the mosque for) salat is charity, and removing harmful things from the
~~way is charity". [al-bukhari and muslim]. commentary: almighty allah
~~has made human body flexible, that is to say, its parts have joints
~~which enable him to make all kinds of movements. if human beings did not
~~have these joints, it would not have been possible for its different
~~parts to make movements which they do. had it been so, one would not
~~have been able to use various parts of his body as he likes. thus, these
~~joints are a valuable gift from allah for which one should always be
~~grateful to him. in all, a person has three hundred and sixty joints in
~~his body, as has already been stated in a hadith narrated earlier.
~~according to some ahadith, two rak`ah of duha prayer (optional forenoon
~~prayer) has been regarded sufficient for this purpose, while in others,

~~gratefulness to allah, he should refrain from harming others as it is a

# وعن أم كلثوم بنت عقبة بن أبي معيط رضي الله عنها قالت سمعت رسول الله

~~شيء مما يقول الناس إلا في ثلاث : تعني الحرب والإصلاح بين الناس وحديث
~~الرجل امرأته وحديث المرأة زوجها 249. umm kulthum bint `uqbah (may allah
~~be pleased with her) reported: messenger of allah (pbuh) said, 'the
~~person who (lies) in order to conciliate between people is not a liar,
~~when he conveys good or says (something) good". [al-bukhari and muslim].
~~the narration in muslim added: she said, "i never heard him (she meant
~~the prophet (pbuh)) giving permission of lying in anything except in
~~three (things): war, conciliating between people and the conversation of
~~man with his wife and the conversation of a woman with her husband".
~~commentary: this hadith tells us a very important principle, that is, in
~~spite of its being unlawful, one is permitted to tell a lie if one has
~~to do it for reforming one's society or family or in the interest of
~~muslims in general. if two muslim brothers are estranged and someone
~~communicates to them such things which are likely to remove conflict and
~~rancour between them, promote mutual love and bring them nearer to each
~~other, such action, even if it has a lie, is not called a lie in islam.
~~1. in order to keep the enemy unaware of the true position, it is
~~permissible to make false propaganda as it is an indispensable device
~~for winning war. 2. in order to maintain pleasant atmosphere in family
~~life, and for this purpose telling a lie becomes inevitable. shari`ah
~~has permitted lying on such occasions. PageV01P0313

~~[ أين المتألي على الله لا يفعل المعروف ؟ ] فقال : أنا يا رسول الله فله

~~be pleased with her) reported: messenger of allah (pbuh) heard the
~~voices of altercation of two disputants at the door; both the voices
~~were quite loud. one was asking the other to make his debts little (so
~~that he could pay them) and was pleading with him to show leniency to
~~him, whereupon the (other one) said: "by allah, i will not do that".
~~then there came messenger of allah (pbuh) to them and said, "where is he
~~who swore by allah that he would not do good?'' he said: "o messenger of
~~allah, it is me. now he may do as he desires". [al-bukhari and muslim].
~~commentary: this hadith highlights the following four main points: 1.
~~it is desirable to help someone who is in straitened circumstances
~~because of a debt. if the lender forgives a part of the loan or gives
~~concession of time in repayment of loan, it is an act of great merit. as
~~allah says: "and if the debtor is in a hard time (has no money), then
~~grant him time till it is easy for him to repay; but if you remit it by
~~way of charity, that is better for you if you did but know.'' (2:280)
~~2. if someone seems to incline towards evil, he should be scolded so
~~that he would keep himself away from it and would turn to virtue. 3.
~~such people who quarrel among themselves should not be left to mutual
~~bickering but efforts should be made for their reconciliation. 4.
~~people who are quarrelling should also co-operate with those who make
~~efforts for reconciliation, and respect their spirit of goodwill. :

~~him) reported: there was some quarrel among the members of banu `amr bin
~~`auf. messenger of allah (pbuh) went with some of his companions to
~~bring about peace between them and he was detained. the time for salat
~~approached and bilal (may allah be pleased with them) went to abu bakr
~~(may allah be pleased with him) and said to him: "messenger of allah
~~(pbuh) has got late and it is the time for salat. will you lead salat?''
~~he said: "yes, if you desire". bilal (may allah be pleased with him)
~~proclaimed the adhan and then pronounced iqamah. abu bakr (may allah be
~~pleased with him) stepped forward and commenced as-salat. (he recited
~~takbir and the people followed him). in the meantime, messenger of allah
~~(pbuh) arrived and, passing through the rows, took his stand in the
~~first row. the people started clapping. it was the habit of abu bakr
~~(may allah be pleased with him) that whenever he started praying, he
~~would never look round. he paid no heed (to the clapping). when the
~~clapping increased, he turned round and saw messenger of allah (pbuh).
~~he (the prophet (pbuh)) beckoned him to continue performing salat. but
~~abu bakr (may allah be pleased with him) raised his hands and praised
~~allah. then he retreated, taking his steps backwards. when messenger of
~~allah (pbuh) saw that, he went ahead and led salat. when he finished
~~salat, he faced the congregation and said, "why do you clap when
~~something happens during the salat. clapping is only for women. if
~~something happens in the course of salat you should say, subhan allah.
~~it is bound to attract attention. and you, abu bakr, what prevented you
~~from carrying on with salat, after i beckoned to do so?'' he said, "it
~~was not becoming for the son of abu quhafah to lead salat in the
~~presence of messenger of allah (pbuh)". [al-bukhari and muslim].
~~commentary: 1. banu `amr bin `auf was a big tribe of aus which consisted
~~of many families, they lived in quba. a quarrel arose among them on some
~~issue and they used stones and brickbats against each other. when the
~~prophet (pbuh) came to know about it, he personally went to them. the
~~hadith shows how important it is to bring about reconciliation amongst
~~muslims who are estranged from each other so that tension among them is
~~not aggravated. if efforts are not made for reconciliation at the
~~initial stages, the conflict will be escalated and then it will become
~~difficult to resolve it. 2. salat can be offered behind two imam, one
~~after the other. 3. in the course of salat if imam makes an error, his
~~followers should bring it to his attentions by saying the words "subhan
~~allah'' aloud. women may clap only. 4. in case of need, it is
~~permissible in salat to turn one's face slightly, to look with glances
~~and move a little onward or backward. such an act does not constitute a
~~defect which renders the prayer invalid. PageV01P0315

~~speaks, he is not to be listened to.'' messenger of allah (pbuh) said,
~~"he is better than the former by earthfuls". [al-bukhari and muslim].
~~commentary: this hadith contains the following two important points: 1.
~~the distinction and greatness of such poor muslims who are neither known
~~in society because due to their poverty nor are they respected by
~~people. but due to their faith and piety, each of them is better in the
~~sight of allah than others. this hadith makes it abundantly clear that

~~in respect of religion rather than worldly wealth and richness. .

~~abu sa`id al-khudri (may allah be pleased with him) reported: the

~~the hell said: "the haughty and proud are my inmates.'' jannah said:
~~"the modest and the humble are my residents". thereupon, allah the
~~exalted and glorious (addressing jannah) said: "you are my mercy,
~~through you i shall show mercy to those whom i wish". (and addressing
~~the hell), he said: "you are (the means) of my punishment by which i
~~shall punish such of my slaves as i wish and each one of you would have
~~its fill". [muslim]. commentary: in this hadith people who are termed
~~as `modest' and `humble' are the rich in faith and piety. they lead a
~~life of patience and contentment. this hadith gives glad tidings to such
~~noble people. on the contrary, it has a threat of hell for those who
~~disobey divine injunctions and are haughty and proud. now, it is
~~entirely one's own choice which way he goes. the dialogue between

# 259. abu hurairah (may allah be pleased with him) reported: the
~~prophet (pbuh) said, "none spoke in the cradle but only three (persons),
~~isa (jesus) son of maryam (mary), the second one was the companion of
~~juraij who was a pious person. juraij took a secluded monastery for
~~worship and confined himself in it. his mother came to him as he was
~~busy in prayer and she called: `juraij.' he said: `my rubb, my mother
~~(is calling me while i am engaged in) my prayer.' he continued with the
~~prayer. she returned and she came on the next day and he was (still)
~~busy in prayer. she called: `juraij.' and he said: `my rubb, my mother
~~(is calling me while i am engaged) in prayer, and he continued with the
~~prayer,' and she returned. then on the next day she again came while he
~~was busy in prayer and called: `juraij.' and he said: `my rubb, my
~~mother (is calling me while i am engaged) in my prayer.' and he
~~continued with the prayer. she said: `my rubb, don't let him die until
~~he has seen the faces of the prostitutes.' the story of juraij and that
~~of his meditation and prayer spread amongst banu israel. there was a
~~prostitute who had been a beauty personified. she said (to the people):
~~`if you like, i can lure him to evil.' she presented herself to him but
~~he paid no heed (to her). she came to a shepherd who lived near the
~~temple and she offered herself to him. he (the shepherd) had sexual
~~intercourse with her and so she became pregnant. when she gave birth to
~~a baby she said: `this is from juraij.' so they came and asked juraij to
~~get down and demolished the temple and began to beat him. he asked them
~~what the matter was. they said: `you have committed fornication with
~~this prostitute and she has given birth to a baby from you.' he said:
~~`where is the baby?' they brought him (the baby) and then he said: `just
~~leave me so that i should perform prayer.' he performed prayer and when
~~he finished, he lifted the baby in his stomach and asked him: `o boy,
~~who is your father?' the baby answered: `he is such and such a
~~shepherd.' so, the people turned towards juraij, kissed him and touched
~~him (for seeking blessing) and said: `we are prepared to construct your
~~temple with gold.' he said, `no just, rebuild it with mud as it had
~~been,' and so they did". (the prophet (pbuh) continued:) "then there was
~~a baby who was sucking at his mother's breast when a person dressed in
~~fine garment came on a priceless riding animal's back. his mother said:
~~`o allah, make my child like this one.' he (the babe) left sucking and
~~looked at him, and said: `o allah, don't make me like him.' he then
~~returned to the breast and resumed sucking.'' he (abu hurairah (may
~~allah be pleased with him) said: as though i can see messenger of allah
~~(pbuh) as he is illustrating the scene of his sucking milk with his
~~forefinger in his mouth and sucking that. he (abu hurairah (may allah be
~~pleased with him)) further reported messenger of allah (pbuh) as saying,
~~"there happened to pass by them a slave girl who was being beaten and
~~they were saying: `you have committed fornication and theft.' she was
~~saying: `allah is enough for me and he is my good protector, and his
~~mother said: `o allah, don't make my child like her.' he left sucking
~~looked at her and said: `o allah! make me like her.' it was followed by
~~a conversation between the mother and the child. she said: `a good
~~looking man happened to pass by and i said: o allah, make my child like
~~him, and you said: o allah, don't make me like him, and there passed a
~~girl while they were beating her and saying: you committed fornication
~~and theft, and i said: o allah, don't make my child like her, and you
~~said: o allah, make me like her.' the child said: `that man was a
~~tyrant, and i said: o allah don't make me like him; and they were saying
~~about the girl: you committed fornication, whereas in fact she had not
~~committed that and they were saying: you have committed theft, whereas
~~she had not committed theft, so i said: o allah, make me like her". [al-
~~bukhari and muslim]. commentary: this hadith tells us of three babies
~~who spoke in the cradle. all the three babies were from banu israel and
~~their story is mentioned in sahih muslim in the story of ashab-ul-
~~ukhdud. this hadith proves the following points: 1. when a person is
~~called by his parents while he is engaged in voluntary prayer, he should
~~give priority to the call of parents. 2. a true muslim has to pass
~~sometimes through great trials. he must face them with patience and
~~steadfastness because ultimately almighty allah helps the true
~~believers. 3. one must avoid copying haughty people no matter how
~~attractive their appearance is. one should try to emulate the virtuous
~~people because true success lies in their conduct. PageV01P0325

~~hurairah (may allah be pleased with him) reported: messenger of allah
~~(pbuh) said, "a miskin (needy) is not the one who can be turned away
~~with a date-fruit or two, or a morsel or two. the true miskin is one
~~who, despite his poverty, abstains from begging". [al-bukhari and

~~miskin is not the one who goes round begging from people and who can be
~~turned away with a morsel or two, or a date-fruit or two. a true miskin
~~is he who does not find enough to suffice him, does not disclose his
~~poverty so that he might be given alms, and does not stand up to beg".
~~[al-bukhari and muslim]. commentary: this hadith throws light on a very
~~important problem relating to beggars who go door to door begging. they
~~are, in fact, not poor because they accumulate a lot of wealth through
~~small amounts which they collect every day. the real needy and poor are
~~those who are not well-to-do, but their appearance and dress hide their
~~poverty. their self-respect does not permit them to make a request for
~~help. the real purport of this hadith is that it is the latter category
~~of poor people, with a sense of self-respect, who should be given
~~preference in financial help over the professional beggars because it is
~~they who are really poor. PageV01P0332

~~commentary: here the words `widow' and `poor' have been mentioned for
~~example only while they cover the whole range of indigent, invalid and
~~needy people. efforts for their care, support and welfare has been
~~regarded equivalent to jihad. islam has done full justice in supporting
~~the helpless individuals and the entire poor class of the society by
~~elevating the status of those who undertake this noble task to the level
~~of mujahidun. it makes it clear that worship is not restricted to

~~who are always mindful of the weak and the poor and constantly strive

~~(may allah be pleased with him) reported: the prophet (pbuh) said, "the
~~worst food is the food of the marriage banquet from which those are left
~~out who would like to come; and to which those are invited who refuse to
~~come. he who rejects an invitation disobeys allah and his messenger".
~~[muslim]. in another narration messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "the
~~worst food is the food of the marriage banquet to which the rich are
~~invited and from which the poor are left out". [muslim]. commentary:
~~our rich class has made walimah (marriage banquet given by the
~~bridegroom) a highly luxurious affair and a means of displaying wealth
~~and richness. this excessive exaggeration of a simple feast has brought
~~in its wake many religious, moral and social evils. in its present form,
~~it is sheer extravagance and wastage which are satanic acts and those
~~who do it are brothers of satan. it is such a big loss and serious
~~threat that if our rich class is left with any sense of religion, it
~~should immediately abandon this extravagance which is escalating day by
~~day. its moral disadvantage is that one invites in this function only
~~men of his own status and not the the poor, whereas the fact is that it
~~is the latter who deserve to be invited because of their need, and not
~~the former. good manners also warrant that the needy should be given
~~priority over the affluent. its social disadvantage is that display of
~~wealth on such occasions creates a sense of deprivation in the poor
~~segments of society while what islam teaches is the uplift, material and
~~moral help, consolation and encouragement and respectable treatment of
~~the poor. instead of holding sumptuous feasts on walimah, if the
~~muslims shift to one or two simple food items and invite the poor along
~~with their friends and relatives, they not only save themselves from all
~~the three evils mentioned above, but also prevent themselves from the
~~accountability in the hereafter; otherwise they will suffer loss in both
~~the worlds. this hadith exhorts the muslims to participate in the
~~walimah ceremony but it is the kind of feast which is simple and in
~~accordance with the teachings of islam. PageV01P0334

~~attain maturity, he and i will come on the day of resurrection like
~~this". messenger of allah (pbuh) joined his fingers illustrating this.
~~[muslim]. commentary: in the pre-islamic era, arabs were greatly
~~dejected and showed resentment on the birth of a daughter, which in fact
~~reflected the status of women in society, in order to give them their
~~rightful place in the society, islam taught its followers to recognize
~~their legitimate rights. among the injunctions which were issued in this
~~behalf, the most important was that their proper upbringing, education
~~and training were made a means to attain jannah so that people did not
~~only feel joy over the birth of sons but also felt pleasure on the birth
~~of daughters. in this respect, islam is the first religion which has not
~~only ensured protection of their rights but also made full arrangements
~~for their respect and prestige in society. for instance, they have been
~~prohibited from having close contacts with men and for this purpose
~~restriction of the veil has been imposed on them. islam has emancipated
~~them from the obligation of earning their own livelihood so that they
~~are safe from the malicious eyes of evil-minded, and secure from the
~~sexual lust of men, the way it is happening with women who are working
~~side by side with men in the west. but it is a curse indeed that due to
~~intellectual immaturity and evil trends, this freedom of women, which
~~has disgraced and robbed them of the virtues of a chaste life, is liked
~~by many people and they are trying that muslim women should also imitate
~~the style of western women. to the people of such crooked thinking, the
~~islamic teachings, which ensure the honour and chastity of women, appear
~~to be the yoke of slavery and they want to release women from it.

~~acceptance of the invocations of the weak and poor. since their hearts
~~are free from the worldly vices and are gifted with greater sincerity

~~فإن ذهبت تقيمه كسرته وإن تركته لم يزل أعوج فاستوصوا بالنساء ] متفق عليه
~~وفي رواية في الصحيحين [ المرأة كالضلع : إن أقمتها كسرتها وإن استمتعت بها

~~abu hurairah (may allah be pleased with him) reported: messenger of
~~allah (pbuh) said: "take my advice with regard to women: act kindly
~~towards women, for they were created from a rib, and the most crooked
~~part of a rib is its uppermost. if you attempt to straighten it; you
~~will break it, and if you leave it alone it will remain crooked; so act
~~kindly toward women". [al-bukhari and muslim]. in another narration of
~~al-bukhari and muslim, messenger of allah (pbuh) said: "a woman is like
~~a rib, if you attempt to straighten it, you will break it; and if you
~~benefit from her, you will do so while crookedness remains in her". in

~~if you want to benefit from her, you will benefit from her while
~~crookedness remains in her. if you attempt to straighten her, you will
~~break her, and breaking her is divorcing her". commentary: the words
~~(istawso bi' nisa') mean, take care of your wives. whatever is the
~~formation of the words of the hadith, it stresses the importance of kind
~~treatment to wives because woman is not only weaker than man by nature,
~~but also less intelligent. on account of his being more intelligent and
~~having greater patience, man should be more forgiving in his dealing

~~فوعظ فيهن فقال : [ يعمد أحدكم فيجلد امرأته جلد العبد فلعله يضاجعها من
~~آخر يومه ] ثم وعظهم في ضحكهم من الضرطة فقال : [ لم يضحك أحدكم مما يفعل ]
~~متفق عليه و [ العارم ] بالعين المهملة والراء : هو الشرير المفسد وقوله [
~~انبعث ] أي قام بسرعة 274. `abdullah bin zam`ah (may allah be pleased
~~with him) reported that he heard the prophet (pbuh) giving a speech when
~~he mentioned the she-camel (of prophet salih) and the man who had killed
~~her. messenger of allah (pbuh) said: "when the most wicked man among
~~them went forth (to kill the she-camel).' (91:12) signifies that a
~~distinguished, wicked and most powerful chief of the people jumped up to
~~kill the she-camel.'' then he (pbuh) made mention of women and said,
~~"some of you beat your wives as if they were slaves, and then lie with
~~them at the end of the day". then he (pbuh) admonished them against
~~laughing at another's passing of wind, saying, "why does any of you
~~laugh at another doing what he does himself" [al-bukhari and muslim].
~~commentary: although islam has permitted man, in inevitable
~~circumstances, to rebuke his wife, it has also suggested a very wise
~~course for it. it has suggested that first of all he should advise and
~~preach her, and if she does not mend her ways by these means, then he
~~should stop sleeping with her, which is a great warning for the sensible
~~wife. if she does not improve even by this method, then he may take
~~recourse to slight beating, but in that he must avoid her head and face.
~~he should take recourse to beating if he thinks that it would work,
~~otherwise it is better to avoid it. but surprisingly enough some start
~~the process of reformation with beating and that too with great
~~ruthlessness which has not been permitted by islam in any case. it is
~~this aspect which the prophet (pbuh) has highlighted in this hadith. he
~~has contended that when the wife is indispensable for man and it is very
~~difficult for him to pass night without her then why should he beat her
~~like a slave or bondmaid? he should try to understand that she, too, has
~~feelings and her position is like one of the two wheels of the cart of
~~life. if at all it comes to beating her then he must keep her true
~~status in view before taking recourse to it. he should never loose sight
~~of her importance in conjugal life. 275. abu hurairah (may allah be

~~make him accountable before allah. the words used in this hadith are so
~~comprehensive that they include servants and slaves besides family and

~~grandfather (may allah be pleased with him) said: messenger of allah
~~(pbuh) said, "command your children to perform salat (prayer) when they
~~are seven years old, and beat them for (not offering) it when they are
~~ten, and do not let (boys and girls) sleep together". [abu dawud].
~~commentary: this hadith highlights the following points: 1. the
~~importance of the prescribed five daily salat (prayers). 2. when
~~warranted by the situation, it is permissible to beat children for their
~~proper upbringing and education. but this should not be in any case
~~violent and aggressive. it should rather be done in a manner that the
~~child does not suffer any physical injury and receives the right type of
~~training. it is an absurd theory that children should be given a free
~~hand, and leave alone the corporal punishment, they should not even be
~~rebuked on doing something wrong. suitable punishment is essential for
~~their proper training and education. 3. muslim jurists have written that
~~like salat, other injunctions of shari`ah should also be instilled in
~~the minds of children, and if possible, they should also be given
~~practical training for their performance. for instance, they should be
~~made to observe saum (fast) occasionally in accordance with their age
~~and capacity during the month of ramadan, so that the importance of
~~obligation of fasting is impressed on their minds in an early age. this
~~exercise will prove very fruitful when they attain maturity. they will
~~then be conscious that for a muslim, fasting in the month of ramadan is
~~compulsory like the five daily salat. 4. a child generally does not
~~attain maturity at the age of ten years, but nevertheless he does
~~acquire some sense. it is, therefore, necessary that rather than putting
~~children in one bed they are provided separate beds once they reach the
~~age of 10, especially children of the opposite sex. PageV01P0378

~~"the best of companions with allah is the one who is best to his
~~companions, and the best of neighbours to allah is the one who is the
~~best of them to his neighbour". [at-tirmidhi]. commentary: companion is
~~a common word which covers companions in journey and stay. muslims are
~~ordained to treat all of them nicely. but one's neighbour has precedence
~~over others. nice treatment to him is the best means to attain a
~~distinctive place with allah. PageV01P0390

# وعن أبي عبد الرحمن عبد الله بن مسعود رضي الله عنه قال : سألت النبي
~~صلى الله عليه و سلم أي العمل أحب إلى الله ؟ قال : [ الصلاة على وقتها ]
~~قلت : ثم أي ؟ قال : [ بر الوالدين ] قلت : ثم أي ؟ قال : [ الجهاد في سبيل
~~الله ] متفق عليه 312. `abdullah bin mas`ud (may allah be pleased with
~~him) reported: i asked the prophet (pbuh) , "which of the deeds is loved
~~most by allah?'' messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "salat at its proper
~~time.'' i asked, ``what next?'' he (pbuh) replied, ``kindness to
~~parents.'' i asked, ``what next?'' he replied, ``jihad in the way of
~~allah.'' [al-bukhari and muslim]. commentary: performance of salat at
~~the stated time means its performance in earliest prescribed or at least
~~its regularity. one should not give preference to mundane affairs over
~~it. salat and jihad are the two most meritorious duties of a muslim.
~~when nice treatment to parents is mentioned along with salat and jihad,
~~it gives further importance to this injunction. PageV01P0393

~~(pbuh) said, "no son can repay (the kindness shown by his father) unless

~~messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "he who believes in allah and the last
~~day, let him be hospitable to his guest; and he who believes in allah
~~and the last day, let him maintain good the ties of blood relationship;
~~and he who believes in allah and the last day, must speak good or remain
~~silent". [al-bukhari and muslim]. commentary: this hadith is mentioned
~~here to highlight the importance of kindness to relatives. it enjoins
~~considerate treatment to relatives and stresses that one should maintain
~~relationship with them at all costs. so much so that even if they
~~misbehave and sever relations with him, one should make efforts to
~~restore not only relationship with them but also their rights. this is
~~what kindness to relatives really means. islam has laid great stress on
~~it. relatives include both paternal and maternal relatives. PageV01P0395

~~abu hurairah (may allah be pleased with him) reported: messenger of
~~allah (pbuh) said, "allah created all the creatures and when he finished
~~the task of his creation, ar-rahm (ties of relationship) said: `(o
~~allah) at this place i seek refuge with you against severing my ties.'
~~allah said: `that i treat with kindness those who treat you with
~~kindness and sever ties with those who sever ties with you.' it said: `i

~~(pbuh) said, "recite this ayah if you like: `would you then, if you were
~~given the authority, do mischief in the land, and sever your ties of
~~kinship? such are they whom allah has cursed, so that he has made them
~~deaf and blinded their sight". (47:22,23). [al-bukhari and muslim]. the
~~words in al-bukhari are: messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "allah (swt)
~~says: `he who maintains good ties with you, i maintain good ties with
~~him; and he who severs your ties, i sever ties with him". commentary:
~~this hadith also stresses the importance of proper treatment with
~~relatives for the reason that this is a special means of attaining the
~~nearness and mercy of allah. a conduct contrary to it, that is to say,
~~devouring the rights of relatives and continuation of estrangement with
~~them, is the cause of displeasure and wrath of allah. PageV01P0396

~~؟ قال : [ أمك ] قال : ثم من ؟ قال : [ أمك ] قال : ثم من ؟ قال : [ أبوك ]

~~وقوله : [ ثم أباك ] هكذا هو منصوب بفعل محذوف : أي ثم بر أباك . وفي رواية
~~[ ثم أبوك ] وهذا واضح 316. abu hurairah (may allah be pleased with him)
~~reported: a person came to messenger of allah (pbuh) and asked, "who
~~among people is most deserving of my fine treatment?'' he (pbuh) said,
~~"your mother". he again asked, ``who next?'' "your mother", the prophet
~~(pbuh) replied again. he asked, "who next?'' he (the prophet (pbuh))
~~said again, "your mother.'' he again asked, "then who?'' thereupon he
~~(pbuh) said,'' then your father.'' in another narration: "o messenger of
~~allah! who is most deserving of my fine treatment?'' he (pbuh) said,
~~"your mother, then your mother, then your mother, then your father, then
~~your nearest, then nearest". [al-bukhari and muslim]. commentary: this
~~hadith tells us that the rights of the mother are three times more
~~important than that of the father for the reasons that: 1 she is weaker
~~than the father. 2. the following three troubles are borne exclusively
~~by the mother while the father does not share them with her: a) she
~~carries the baby in her womb for nine months, b) the labor pain which
~~she suffers. c) two years' period of suckling which disturbs her sleep
~~at night and affects her health. she has also to be very cautious in her
~~food for the welfare of the baby. PageV01P0397

# وعنه رضي الله عنه عن النبي صلى الله عليه و سلم قال : [ رغم أنف ثم رغم
~~أنف ثم رغم أنف من أدرك أبويه عند الكبر أحدهما أو كليهما فلم يدخل الجنة ]
~~رواه مسلم 317. abu hurairah (may allah be pleased with him) reported:
~~the prophet (pbuh) said, "may he be disgraced! may he be disgraced! may
~~he be disgraced, whose parents, one or both, attain old age during his
~~life time, and he does not enter jannah (by rendering being dutiful to
~~them)". [muslim]. commentary: the word ``ragham'' means soil. when a
~~person's nose is soiled, it is a mark of his extreme humiliation. this
~~metaphor carries a curse for an unfortunate person who does not win the
~~pleasure of allah by serving and obeying his parents. in fact, it is a
~~malediction as well as a prediction of someone's inauspicious end.
~~service of parents is essential at every stage of their life - whether
~~they are young or old. but this hadith mentions their old age for the
~~reason that in that period of their life they stand in greater need of
~~care and service. it is a very callous offense to leave them at the
~~mercy of circumstances when they are old, senile and depend on others
~~for their needs. to neglect them at that stage is a major sin for which
~~one deserves hell-fire. PageV01P0398

~~ولا شيء على هذا المحسن إليهم لكن ينالهم إثم عظيم بتقصيرهم في حقه
~~وإدخالهم الأذى عليه والله أعلم 318. abu hurairah (may allah be pleased

~~relatives with whom i try to keep the ties of relationship but they
~~sever relations with me; and whom i treat kindly but they treat me
~~badly, i am gentle with them but they are rough to me.'' he (pbuh)
~~replied, "if you are as you say, it is as if you are feeding them hot
~~ashes, and you will be with a supporter against them from allah as long
~~as you continue to do so". [muslim]. commentary: this hadith has three
~~important lessons: first, the misbehaviour of one's relative is no
~~justification for the misbehaviour of another, let alone the severing of
~~relations on that account. second, the person who treats his relatives
~~nicely in all events and circumstances is blessed by allah who will send
~~from heaven helpers to support him. third, the consequence of denying
~~compassion and kindness to relatives is as woeful as the eating of hot
~~ashes. PageV01P0399

# وعن أنس رضي الله عنه أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم قال : [ من أحب

~~ample provisions and his life be prolonged, should maintain good ties
~~with his blood relations". [al-bukhari and muslim]. commentary: one who
~~is benevolent and compassionate towards one's own relatives, stands to
~~gain at least two definite advantages in this world besides the reward
~~in the next. these two advantages are the increase in his subsistence
~~and longevity of life. increase in subsistence means that almighty allah
~~will increase the quantity of his worldly goods or his means of
~~subsistence will be blessed by him. similar is the case of longevity of
~~life. the life of such person is either actually increased (in terms of
~~years) or his life is graced with the blessings of allah. both
~~interpretations are correct. PageV01P0400

~~يقول : { لن تنالوا البر حتى تنفقوا مما تحبون } وإن أحب مالي إلي بيرحاء
~~وإنها صدقة لله تعالى أرجو برها وذخرها عند الله فضعها يا رسول الله حيث

~~مال رابح وقد سمعت ما قلت وإني أرى أن تجعلها في الأقربين ] فقال أبو طلحة
~~: أفعل يا رسول الله . فقسمها أبو طلحة في أقاربه وبني عمه . متفق عليه

~~anas (may allah be pleased with him) reported: abu talhah (may allah be
~~pleased with him) was the richest among the ansar of al-madinah and
~~possessed the largest property; and among his possessions what he loved
~~most was his garden known as bairuha' which was opposite the mosque, and
~~messenger of allah (pbuh) often visited it and drank from its fresh
~~water. when this ayah was revealed: "by no means shall you attain al-
~~birr (piety, righteousness - here it means allah's reward, i.e.,
~~jannah), unless you spend (in allah's cause) of that which you love,''
~~(3:92). abu talhah came to messenger of allah (pbuh), and said: "allah
~~says in his book: `by no means shall you attain al-birr, unless you
~~spend (in allah's cause) of that which you love,' and the dearest of my
~~property is bairuha' so i have given it as sadaqah (charity) for allah's
~~sake, and i anticipate its reward with him; so spend it, o messenger of
~~allah, as allah guides you". messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "well-done!
~~that is profitable property. i have heard what you have said, but i
~~think you should spend it on your nearest relatives.'' so abu talhah
~~distributed it among his nearest relatives and cousins. [al-bukhari and
~~muslim]. commentary: this hadith has already been mentioned in the
~~chapter which deals with the merits of spending of what one loves best
~~in the way of allah. it has been repeated here in support of benevolence
~~to the relatives. its repetition makes it clear that while spending in
~~the way of allah, one should always first of all consider his relatives
~~and help those of them who deserve assistance. after fulfilling their
~~needs, if anything remains then it can be given to others. PageV01P0401

~~swear allegiance to you for emigration and jihad, seeking reward from
~~allah.'' he (pbuh) said, "is any of your parents alive?'' he said, "yes,
~~both of them are alive.'' he (pbuh) then asked, "do you want to seek
~~reward from allah?'' he replied in the affirmative. thereupon messenger
~~of allah (pbuh) said, "go back to your parents and keep good company
~~with them". [al-bukhari and muslim]. in another narration it is reported
~~that a person came to messenger of allah (pbuh) and sought his
~~permission to participate in jihad. the prophet (pbuh) asked, "are your
~~parents alive?'' he replied in the affirmative. the prophet a(pbuh)
~~said, "(you should) consider their service as jihad.'' commentary: under
~~normal circumstances, jihad is fard kifayah (collective duty -- which
~~means that if some people observe it, the rest of the muslims will be
~~exempted from its obligation). in such circumstances permission of
~~parents to participate in jihad is necessary because their service is
~~fard-ul-`ain (individual duty -- an injunction or ordinance, the
~~obligation of which extends to every muslim in person), and the former
~~cannot be preferred to the latter. this hadith explains such a
~~situation. in certain circumstances, however, jihad becomes fard-ul-`ain
~~and in that case permission of the parents to take part in jihad is not
~~essential because then every muslim is duty-bound to take part in it.

~~بفتح القاف والطاء و [ رحمة ] مرفوع 322. `abdullah bin `amr al-`as (may
~~allah be pleased with them) reported: the prophet (pbuh) said, "the
~~person who perfectly maintains the ties of kinship is not the one who
~~does it because he gets recompensed by his relatives (for being kind and
~~good to them), but the one who truly maintains the bonds of kinship is
~~the one who persists in doing so even though the latter has severed the
~~ties of kinship with him". [al-bukhari]. commentary: this hadith makes
~~clear the essentials of kindness to relatives. those kinsmen who respect
~~and honour you, would obviously be treated by you fairly. it goes
~~without saying that people usually reciprocate sentiments showed to
~~them. but this is not maintaining the ties of kinship but kindness for
~~kindness. on the opposite side, there is a kinsman who is rough and rude
~~and is always bent upon severing relation with you, but you tolerate his
~~excesses with patience and perseverance, return his harshness with
~~politeness, maintain relationship with him in spite of all his efforts
~~to break it, then what you are exercising is maintaining the ties of
~~kinship. this is what islam actually demands from a muslim. but this is
~~the excellence of faith which one must try to attain. there is nothing
~~remarkable in exchanging dry smiles. PageV01P0403

# وعن عائشة رضي الله عنها قالت : قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم قال
~~: [ الرحم معلقة بالعرش تقول : من وصلني وصله الله ومن قطعني قطعه الله ]

~~from the throne, and says: `he who keeps good relations with me, allah
~~will keep connection with him, but whosoever severs relations with me,
~~allah will sever connection with him". [al-bukhari and muslim].
~~commentary: the discourse on compassion to relatives mentioned in this
~~hadith is not impossible because almighty allah is omnipotent and is

~~hadith brings out the following two points: 1) a woman is free to spend
~~anything of her own property without the permission of her husband, but
~~not of things owned by her husband. 2) to spend on the needy relatives
~~is more meritorious than to set a slave free because to set a slave free
~~is a sadaqah (charity) only, while paying sadaqah to a kinsman has a
~~double merit as it carries the reward of sadaqah as well as "maintaining
~~the ties of kinship.'' PageV01P0405

~~who does not possess much, and messenger of allah (pbuh) has commanded
~~us to give sadaqah. so go and ask him if giving to you will serve the
~~purpose; otherwise, i shall give it to someone else.'' he asked me that
~~i should better go myself. i went and found a woman of the ansar at the
~~door of messenger of allah (pbuh), waiting to ask a similar question as
~~mine. the prophet (pbuh) was endowed with dignity, and so we could not
~~go in. when bilal (may allah be pleased with him) came out to us, we

~~the wife of `abdullah bin mas`ud, he (pbuh) said, "they will have a
~~double reward, one for maintaining the ties of kinship and another for
~~sadaqah". [al-bukhari and muslim]. commentary: 1. we learn from this
~~hadith that a woman can also give sadaqah and zakat to her husband,
~~provided he is poor. but its opposite is not permissible. that is to
~~say, a husband cannot pay zakat to his wife because he is responsible
~~for her maintenance while wife is not obliged to do it for her husband.
~~so, the principle deduced from it is that one who is bound to pay zakat
~~under the shari`ah is not permitted to pay it to his dependents. 2. in
~~case of need, a woman can go out of her house subject to the condition
~~that she observes the restriction of the veil prescribed by the shari`ah
~~in this behalf. 3) like men, women should also take, keen interest in
~~religious matters. they should not feel shy of doing it. PageV01P0407

~~and not to associate a thing with him in worship, to discard what our
~~ancestors said, to perform the salat (prayer), speak the truth, and
~~maintain the ties of kinship". [al-bukhari and muslim]. commentary:
~~besides tauhid (oneness of allah), this hadith enjoins punctuality in
~~salat and excellence of character. in all the forms of worship, salat is
~~the most important, and the best in the nobility of character is
~~righteousness. after professing faith in tauhid and belief that muhammad

~~يسمى فيها القيراط فاستوصوا بأهلها خيرا فإن لهم ذمة ورحما . وفي رواية :
~~فإذا فتحتموها فأحسنوا إلى أهلها فإن لهم ذمة ورحما أو قال ذمة وصهرا ]

~~328. abu dharr (may allah be pleased with him) reported: messenger of
~~allah (pbuh) said, "you will soon conquer a land where people deal with
~~qirat.'' and according to another version: messenger of allah (pbuh)
~~said, "you will soon conquer egypt where al-qirat is frequently
~~mentioned. so when you conquer it, treat its inhabitants well. for there
~~lies upon you the responsibility because of blood ties or relationship
~~(with them)". [muslim]. commentary: in this hadith, the prophet (pbuh)
~~has urged his companions to treat the egyptians nicely for the reason of
~~maintaining the ties of kinship and for the fact that egypt was the
~~country of his in-laws (mariyah, the mother of ibrahim, and one of the
~~prophet's wives was from that place). this is why this hadith has been
~~included in the present chapter which deals with the subject of
~~maintaining the ties of kinship. this hadith is also a prophecy of the
~~prophet (pbuh) due to the fact that the prophecy he had made came true.
~~a short time after his death, egypt became part of the muslim empire.

# وعن أبي هريرة رضي الله عنه قال لما نزلت هذه الآية : { وأنذر عشيرتك
~~الأقربين } ( الشعراء 214 ) دعا رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم قريشا
~~فاجتمعوا فعم وخص فقال : [ يا بني كعب بن لؤي أنقذوا أنفسكم من النار يا
~~بني مرة بن كعب أنقذوا أنفسكم من النار يا بني عبد شمس أنقذوا أنفسكم من

~~وكسرها و [ البلال ] : الماء ومعنى الحديث : سأصلها . شبه قطيعتها بالحرارة
~~تطفأ بالماء وهذه تبرد بالصلة 329. abu hurairah (may allah be pleased
~~with him) reported: when this verse was revealed: "and warn your tribe
~~(o muhammad (pbuh)) of near kindred". (26:214) messenger of allah (pbuh)
~~called the quraish; when they gathered, he said to them: "o sons of `abd
~~shams; o sons of ka`b bin lu'ai, rescue yourselves from the fire! o sons
~~of murrah bin ka`b, rescue yourselves from the fire! o sons of `abd
~~manaf, rescue yourselves from the fire! o sons of `abdul-muttalib,
~~rescue yourselves from the fire! o fatimah, rescue yourself from the
~~fire, for i have no power (to protect you) from allah in anything except
~~that i would sustain relationship with you". [muslim]. commentary: 1.
~~this hadith tells us that lineage in the hereafter will not help
~~anybody. so much so that even one's relationship with messenger of allah
~~(pbuh) shall not carry any weight on that day. the only thing that will
~~then help in salvation will be one's good deeds. people for whom the
~~prophet (pbuh) and pious men will intercede will be believers with some
~~sins in their account and not the disbelievers devoid of faith and good
~~actions. neither will anybody intercede for the infidels, nor will the
~~infidels find salvation. 2. in preaching religion, priority must be
~~given to one's own close relatives. they deserve it more than anyone
~~else, and for this reason divine injunctions should be first of all
~~conveyed to them. 3. even if a muslim's relatives are pagans and
~~polytheists, their rights of kinsmen and the demands of "maintaining the
~~ties of kinship'' enjoined by islam must be fulfilled. the first and
~~foremost demand of their rights is that they should be invited to the
~~right path so that they will be saved from hell-fire. PageV01P0410

~~obedience to parents left that i can show to them after their death?''
~~he (pbuh) replied, "yes, to pray for them, to supplicate for their
~~forgiveness, to fulfill their promises after their death, to maintain
~~the ties of kinship which cannot be maintained except through them, and
~~honour their friends.'' [abu dawud]. commentary: we learn from this
~~hadith that one should consider the life of one's parents a blessing
~~because their life provides one with an opportunity to serve them
~~wholeheartedly, which is ordained by allah. if one wants to be nice to
~~them after their death, one should adopt the methods mentioned in this
~~hadith. it needs to be noted that it does not mention the ceremonies
~~like recitation of the noble qur'an on the third, seventh and fortieth
~~day after the death of a person, in vogue in our society. all these
~~methods of conveying the reward of virtuous deeds or rites are wrong for
~~the reason that they are neither helpful for the dead nor the living.
~~what really benefits the dead as well as living, is prayer and begging
~~forgiveness from allah. in this hadith, these have been regarded as acts
~~of beneficence for the deceased parents. it clearly means that the
~~children will be rewarded for the virtuous acts they do for their
~~parents and the status of the deceased parents will also be elevated in
~~the next world. the acceptance of the prayer in favour of the deceased
~~parents is also confirmed from that hadith also which tells that death
~~brings to an end all the activities, except the following: firstly, an
~~ongoing sadaqah (sadaqah jariyah); like the digging of a well, the
~~building of a mosque, etc., secondly, knowledge which benefits muslims;

~~(may allah be pleased with her) reported: i never felt jealous of any of
~~the wives of the prophet (pbuh) as much as i did of khadijah (may allah
~~be pleased with her), although i have never seen her, but the prophet
~~(pbuh) used to mention her very often. whenever he slaughtered a sheep,
~~he would cut it into pieces and send them to the women friends of
~~khadijah (may allah be pleased with her). when i sometimes said to him:
~~"you treat khadijah in such a way as if there is no woman on earth
~~except her". he (pbuh) would say, "khadijah was such and such
~~(commending her and speaking well of her), and i had children from her".
~~[al-bukhari and muslim]. another narration is: and if he (pbuh)
~~slaughtered a sheep, he would send meat to the friends of khadijah (may
~~allah be pleased with her) as a present as much as would suffice them.
~~another narration is: when a sheep was slaughtered, he (pbuh) would say,
~~"send this meat to khadijah's friends.'' once, halah bint khuwailid (may
~~allah be pleased with her), sister of khadijah (may allah be pleased
~~with her), sought permission of messenger of allah (pbuh) to enter. he
~~recognized and recalled to his mind the manner of khadijah (may allah be
~~pleased with her) and was deeply moved. he said, "o allah, she must be
~~halah bint khuwailid". [al-bukhari and muslim]. commentary: this hadith
~~brings out the following five points: 1. a brief reference to the great
~~qualities of khadijah (may allah be pleased with her). 2. the love that
~~messenger of allah (pbuh) had for khadijah (may allah be pleased with
~~her) because of her great qualities. 3. reference to the kindness which
~~messenger of allah (pbuh) continued to show to the women who were close
~~to khadijah (may allah be pleased with her). 4. expression of the

~~messenger of allah (pbuh), listened to him talking, fought by his side
~~in (different) battles, and offered salat (prayer) behind him. zaid, you
~~have indeed earned great merits. could you narrate to us what you heard

~~al-madinah. he praised allah, extolled him, and exhorted (us) and said,
~~`amma ba`du. o people, i am a human being. i am about to receive a

~~messenger of allah (pbuh) was a human being. he too was subject to the
~~inevitable law of death. 2. it stresses upon the establishment of a firm
~~bond with the book of allah (the qur'an) and lays emphasis on showing

~~members of the prophet's family are classified into two categories:

~~this is established from the categorical verses of the noble qur'an.

~~أنه قال : ارقبوا محمدا صلى الله عليه و سلم في أهل بيته . رواه البخاري
~~معنى [ ارقبوه ] : راعوه واحترموه وأكرموه والله أعلم 347. ibn `umar (may
~~allah be pleased with them) reported: abu bakr (may allah be pleased
~~with him) said: "show reverence to messenger of allah (pbuh) by
~~honouring the members of his family.'' [al-bukhari]. commentary: in this
~~hadith, the love and respect for the members of the prophet's (pbuh)
~~family has been tied with the love and respect of the prophet (pbuh). in
~~other words, a person who loves and respects the descendants of the
~~prophet (pbuh) will be deemed to be a lover and admirer of the prophet
~~(pbuh). on the contrary, one whose heart is devoid of the love of the
~~descendants of the prophet (pbuh), will be considered devoid of the love
~~and respect of the prophet (pbuh). but love and respect here does not
~~mean that they are taken for sinless persons and their status is
~~exaggerated beyond reason, as is the case with the shiites. their whole
~~religious thinking is founded on the exaggeration of the qualities of
~~the members of the family of messenger of allah (pbuh) and they have
~~exhausted their imagination in proving them sinless. while their love
~~and respect lies in adopting the noble features of their character and
~~cherishing their piety. their love and respect does not lie in

~~praise beyond all limits. PageV01P0433

~~من فراش وسرير ونحوهما 348. abu mas`ud `uqbah bin `amr al-badri al-ansari
~~(may allah be pleased with him) reported: messenger of allah (pbuh)
~~said, "the person who is best versed in the recitation of the book of
~~allah, should lead the prayer; but if all those present are equally
~~versed in it, then the one who has most knowledge of the sunnah; if they
~~are equal in that respect too, then the one who has emigrated (to al-
~~madinah) first, if they are equal in this respect also, then the oldest
~~of them. no man should lead another in prayer where the latter has
~~authority, or sit in his house, without his permission". [muslim]. in
~~another narration in muslim: messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "one who is
~~senior most in accepting islam, should lead the salat (prayer)". yet
~~another narration is: messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "a man who is well
~~versed in the book of allah and can recite it better, should lead the
~~salat (prayer); if (all those present) are equal in this respect, then
~~the man who is senior most in respect of emigration, if they are equal
~~in that respect too, then the oldest of them should lead the prayer".
~~[muslim]. commentary: this hadith highlights the following three points:
~~1. the order of priority for the appointment of imam [one who leads as-
~~salat (the prayers) should be as follows: first, preference should go to
~~a good qari (reciter of the noble qur'an) who is also an expert in it,
~~provided he is pious and acts upon the teachings of the noble qur'an
~~faithfully. he should not be a non-practising muslim. nowadays, we have
~~an abundance of imam but many of them are neither pious nor faithfully
~~act upon religious teachings. in any case, where we can find a qari who
~~fulfills the requirements just mentioned, he deserves first preference
~~for appointment as imam. even a religious scholar will come next to him.
~~it must be borne in mind that nice recitation of the noble qur'an does
~~not mean its recitation with great skill, but its essentials are elegant
~~voice, acquaintance with the `ilm-ut-tajwid (or science of reciting the
~~qur'an), clear and distinct recitation. 2. the ruler of a territory, its
~~highest officer and governor should work as imam in their respective
~~areas. in the early ages of islam, these authorities used to administer
~~their areas, dispense justice and lead congregational prayers (salat).
~~3. when one goes to somebody's house, he should not occupy the place
~~reserved for the master of the house unless he himself asks him to sit
~~there. PageV01P0436

~~during the period of the truce (after its conquest) and they separated
~~to perform their duties. when muhaiyisah returned to `abdullah bin sahl,

~~muhaiyisah, the two sons of mas`ud went to messenger of allah (pbuh) and
~~spoke about the case of their (murdered) friend. `abdur-rahman, who was
~~the youngest of them all, started talking. messenger of allah (pbuh)
~~said, "let those older than you speak first.'' so he stopped talking and
~~the (other two) spoke about the case of their (murdered) friend.
~~messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "will you take an oath whereby you will
~~have the right to receive the blood money of your murdered man?'' and
~~mentioned the rest of the hadith.'' [al-bukhari and muslim]. commentary:
~~the author of this book, imam nawawi, has reproduced only that portion
~~of hadith which is related to this chapter. this hadith makes out the
~~following points: 1. the eldest person has the first right to speak in a
~~gathering. but this principle is to be followed when all the persons
~~present there are equal in virtue and intelligence; otherwise, one who
~~is superior to others in these qualities will have a prior right to
~~speak. 2. the hadith explains the issue of qasamah which was in vogue in
~~the pre-islamic period and was maintained by islam. qasamah was a mode
~~of settling cases of undetected murders. in such situations, fifty
~~persons from the heirs of the victim were asked to take an oath that
~~murder was committed by some person of that locality (or some persons
~~from the heirs were required to take oath for fifty times to this
~~effect); after this oath, the people of that area were liable to pay
~~diyah (blood money) to the heirs of the victim. if the persons blamed
~~for the murder said on the similar oath that none of them had committed
~~that offense, they were absolved from the payment of diyah and the
~~payment of blood money was made to the heirs of the victim from the
~~bait-ul-mal (state exchequer). in the incident referred in this hadith
~~when the prophet (pbuh) asked the brothers of the victim to take the
~~required oath, they refused to do so as they were not sure as to who had
~~committed the crime. the prophet (pbuh) did not ask the inhabitants of
~~khaibar for the oath because they were jews and the heirs of the victim
~~did not have faith in them. thus, the prophet (pbuh) himself made the
~~payment of the blood money to the heirs of the victim. PageV01P0439

~~a niche is made on the left side of it to place the corpse. the grave
~~which is straight, a common type, is called darih. this hadith tells

~~the one who commits the qur'an to memory and does not exaggerate

~~interpretations to justify his own intellectual and religious
~~perversion. this hadith stresses that a pious old man, a hamil-ul-qur'an

~~that many `ulama' and qurra' were members of the special advisory

~~"when will be the hour (i.e., the day of resurrection)?" he (the prophet
~~(pbuh)) said, "what preparation have you made for it?'' he said, "only
~~the love of allah and his messenger.'' then messenger of allah (pbuh)
~~said, "you will be with those whom you love.'' [al-bukhari and muslim].
~~the narration in muslim is: the man replied: "i have made no significant
~~preparation with regard to salat (prayer), saum (fasting) and sadaqah
~~(charity) but i love allah and his messenger". commentary: the love of
~~the companions of the prophet (pbuh) for allah and his prophet (pbuh)
~~was not verbal only, as is the case of present-day muslims. their love
~~was full of obedience and submission to allah in the true sense. this is
~~what the bedouin mentioned in this hadith really meant when he said that
~~he had not amassed a large treasure by way of salat, saum (fasts) and
~~sadaqah for presentation on the day of resurrection. what he meant by
~~them was voluntary acts and not the obligations. the reason being that
~~the obligatory acts like salat, saum and zakat are incumbent on every
~~muslim and no one can claim to be a true believer and lover of allah and
~~his prophet (pbuh) who ignores them. any muslim who entertains true love
~~of allah and his prophet (pbuh), makes it evident in his practical life
~~by his strict performance of the duties and obligations enjoined by
~~allah and demonstrated by his prophet (pbuh) through his sunnah. even if
~~such a person does not have to his credit a large amount of voluntary
~~acts, he will be declared successful by allah. this is the real import
~~of this hadith, otherwise a muslim's claim for the love of allah and his
~~prophet (pbuh) will be void if he does not fulfill his religious
~~obligations. in fact, without the fulfillment of religious obligations,
~~his claim will be nothing short of self-deception. his claim for the
~~love of allah and his prophet (pbuh), which is not supported by his
~~actions will carry no weight before allah. this is what the following
~~ayah of the noble qur'an enjoins: "say (o muhammad (pbuh) to mankind:)
~~`if you (really) love allah then follow me (i.e., accept islamic tauhid,
~~follow the qur'an and the sunnah), allah will love you and forgive your
~~sins. and allah is oft-forgiving, most merciful.''' (3:31) PageV01P0459

~~like recruited soldiers, they get mixed up with those similar with them
~~in qualities and oppose and drift away from those who do not share their
~~qualities". [muslim]. commentary: 1. metals differ from each other. some
~~of them are precious and others worthless. similar is the case of the
~~people's conduct and actions. there are people of both kinds in the

~~told the name of owais (may allah be pleased with him) but also some of

~~description given by him. 2. it tells the virtues of simplicity, and
~~anonymity. 3. the merit of nice treatment to mother. 4. this hadith is

# وعن عمر بن الخطاب رضي الله عنه قال : استأذنت النبي صلى الله عليه و

~~(may allah be pleased with him) reported: i sought permission of the
~~prophet (pbuh) to perform `umrah. he granted me leave and said, "dear
~~brother! do not forget us in your supplications". (`umar added): this is
~~something i would not exchange for the whole world. another narration

~~sharh riyad-us-saliheen'' classifies it as "da`if'', the reason being
~~that `asim bin `abdullah is "weak'' in narration]. commentary: it is
~~mustahab (desirable) to request such a person for prayer who is
~~proceeding on a journey, especially one who is going with the intention
~~of hajj or `umrah. the reason being: 1. prayer for someone in his
~~absence is imbued with sincerity. 2. the places a pilgrim visits in the
~~course of hajj are such that prayers made there are accepted by allah.
~~3. it is also mustahab that during the course of hajj when a pilgrim
~~supplicates on special sites and occasions, he should not pray for
~~himself alone but also include his relatives and friends in his
~~supplications. 4. the act of praying for others goes to prove the
~~eminence of religious fraternity of the muslims. the prophet (pbuh) is
~~the spiritual father of the entire muslim community, and is the most
~~superior in nobility and excellence in the whole universe, but in
~~respect of faith, he is also a brother of all the muslims and all the
~~muslims are his brothers. it is illustrated by the fact that he called
~~`umar (may allah be pleased with him) his brother. PageV01P0463

~~`i will declare war against him who treats with hostility a pious
~~worshipper of mine. and the most beloved thing with which my slave comes
~~nearer to me, is what i have enjoined upon him; and my slave keeps on
~~coming closer to me through performing nawafil (voluntary prayers or
~~doing extra deeds besides what is obligatory) until i love him, (so much
~~so that) i become his hearing with which he hears, and his sight with
~~which he sees, and his hand with which he strikes, and his leg with
~~which he walks; and if he asks me something, i will surely give him, and
~~if he seeks my protection (refuge), i will surely protect him". [al-
~~bukhari] commentary: this hadith tell us the status and distinctive
~~signs of the favoured men of allah ('auliya' allah) the noble qur'an has
~~defined them as: "those who believed (in the oneness of allah) and used
~~to fear allah much (by abstaining from evil deeds and sins and by doing
~~righteous deeds)". (10:63). according to this definition, every believer
~~who really fears allah is a favoured of allah. it means that except for
~~faith and piety, favoured of allah are neither people of the special
~~kind nor have they any special distinctive signs, as is generally
~~thought by some people. in this respect, the ignorance of the general
~~public is shocking because they regard even such persons as favoured of
~~allah who not only neglect the religious obligations and the practice of
~~the prophet (pbuh), but also woefully lack cleanliness. sometimes they
~~call even mad or half-mad persons as favourites of allah, whereas a wali
~~in the true sense is one who is meticulous about observing the
~~obligations and is fearful of allah. this hadith brings about the
~~following four points: firstly, the love of those whom allah loves
~~entail the love of allah, and hating them entails the hatred of allah..
~~secondly, when a true muslim acquires nearness and love of allah by
~~means of performing religious obligations, supererogatory and voluntary
~~prayers, allah then becomes his special helper and protects his limbs
~~and organs and does not let them work for his disobedience. then he does
~~not use any part of his body for things which are disliked by him. it is
~~wrong to infer from this hadith, as men of heretical and polytheistic
~~trend try to do, that auliya' become the eyes, ears, hands, feet, etc.
~~of allah. that is to say that almighty allah descends in them. thus, on
~~the basis of this contemptible reasoning, they conclude that it makes no
~~difference whether one begs from allah or auliya because the two are one
~~being. for such people supplicating "o allah! help us'', "o prophet of
~~allah! help us'' and "o ali! help us'' etc., are all right. one who says
~~so has certainly gone astray, rather commits shirk (polytheism). may
~~allah save us from these sins. according to the hadith, a true pious man
~~likes and adopts what is liked by allah, and avoids all such things
~~which are not liked by him. thirdly, the performance of the obligatory
~~acts of worshipping has the first and foremost importance for attaining
~~the pleasure of allah because their fulfillment is liked the most by
~~allah and also because they furnish the foundation, on which the edifice
~~of islam is built. as we cannot think of a building without foundation,
~~similarly, we cannot think of voluntary worship without fulfilling the
~~basic obligations. the fact is that one who neglects them ceases to be a
~~muslim. this is the reason for the severe warnings of allah to those who
~~default on this account. those who neglect voluntary prayers have not
~~been given any warning. it is, however, true that their performance in
~~addition to the obligatory ones increases lustre of obligations. nawafil
~~(voluntary acts of worship) help one to attain the exalted place of
~~being loved by allah by virtue of which one is endowed with the special
~~help of allah. fourthly, almighty allah certainly grants the prayers of
~~those whom he loves. but acceptance of their prayers, however, does not
~~mean that their results appear at once. sometime the results of these
~~prayers appear after a long time. the prayer of virtuous persons is
~~certainly granted but whether it takes a long or short time depends
~~solely on the will of allah. PageV01P0480

~~إلا بحق الإسلام وحسابهم على الله تعالى ] متفق عليه 390. `abdullah bin
~~`umar (may allah be pleased with them) reported: messenger of allah
~~(pbuh) said, "i have been commanded (by allah) to fight people until
~~they testify that there is no true god except allah, and that muhammad
~~is the messenger of allah, and perform salat and pay zakat. if they do
~~so, they will have protection of their blood and property from me except
~~when justified by islam, and then account is left to allah". [al-bukhari
~~and muslim]. commentary: this hadith brings out the following three
~~points: 1. the objective of jihad. this objective warrants that one must
~~struggle against kufr (disbelief) and shirk (polytheism) and the worship
~~of falsehood in all its forms. jihad has to continue until this
~~objective is achieved. this contention is supported by a hadith, to the
~~effect that jihad will continue till the day of resurrection. in this
~~hadith the word (an-nas) translated above as "people" stands for the
~~polytheists and idolaters. the reason being that other nasus (pl. of
~~nass, meaning `text') confirm the exemption of ahl-ul-kitab (people of
~~the scriptures) from it subject to the condition that they agree to pay
~~jizyah (dues imposed by islam on the people of the book living under the
~~protection of an islamic state) and submit to the muslim rule. the arab
~~pagans have only the choice to either embrace islam or face war. in the
~~latter case, it is incumbent on the mulsims to wage jihad against them
~~to wipe out kufr and shirk and raise the banner of tauhid everywhere.
~~this hadith strongly refutes the people who distort the islamic concept
~~of jihad and hold that islam preaches defensive war only. it is an
~~apologetic approach because defensive war has to be fought in any case
~~by every nation and country. thus, it is a compulsion and needs no
~~justification. the real distinction of islam lies in its enjoining
~~muslims to wage war for upholding the truth beside fighting for their
~~own defense. the domination of kufr, shirk and falsehood is darkness,
~~heresy and tyranny, and the objective of islam is to purge the world of
~~all these evils. it aims at liberating man from the worship of man, set
~~them on the path of worship of allah, and to provide a just and
~~equitable society to mankind. wherever in the world there is tyranny,
~~ignorance and heresy, muslims are bound to fight such evils and finish
~~them by means of jihad. there is also a third form of jihad which is
~~waged against countries where muslims are victims of aggression,
~~suppression and cruelties of the non-muslims. it is incumbent upon
~~muslims to liberate their brethren in faith from the clutches of the
~~non-muslims by means of jihad. so long muslims performed this obligation
~~with a sense of duty, islam and its followers were dominant in the world
~~and ever since they have ignored this obligation, both are in
~~subjugation and disgrace. in other words, the secret of power and
~~stability of muslims lies in jihad. muslims need to understand this
~~secret like their ancestors. 2. life and property of every person is
~~secured after his joining the fold of islam. he will, however, be
~~subject to the law of islam, one of which is payment of zakat. if he
~~murders any muslim, he will also be killed in return, unless the heirs
~~of the victim pardon the murderer or accept blood-money (diyah) for it.
~~3. when a person embraces islam, the laws of shari`ah apply to him
~~according to his apparent condition only. his heart will not be probed
~~for this purpose. in case, he is not sincere or he has some design in
~~joining the fold of islam, no action will be taken against him until
~~guilt is fully proved. what he has in his heart will be left to allah
~~who will pass judgement on his intention on the day of resurrection.
~~this hadith is related to this chapter for its third point. in their
~~debate on this point, some `ulama' have contended that such people who
~~believe in tauhid and obey the injunctions of shari`ah are not to be
~~declared as infidels. PageV01P0488

~~cuts off my hands with his sword, then hides from me behind a tree and
~~(then) says he has submitted himself to allah. shall i kill him after he
~~has said it?'' he (pbuh) replied, "do not kill him.'' i submitted, "but
~~o messenger of allah, he cut off one of my hands and only then he said
~~it.'' messenger of allah (pbuh) then replied, "do not kill him, for if
~~you do so, he will be in the position in which you were before you
~~killed him (i.e., he will be considered a muslim and thus his life will
~~be inviolable), and you will be in the position in which he was before
~~he made his testimony (i.e., your life will not be inviolable, for his
~~heirs can ask for qisas)". [al-bukhari and muslim]. commentary: this
~~hadith tells us that injunctions of islam will be enforced on a person
~~according to his apparent condition not his insight. the reason being
~~that nobody is capable of knowing the insight of others. when a person
~~professes islam, we have to accept him a muslim; and it will be our duty
~~to protect his life and property. if, in spite of knowing that his life
~~and property are sacred, a muslim murders him, then it will be quite
~~fair for the heirs of the victim to have qisas for the murder. if the
~~murderer poses ignorance or takes shelter of some reason, then he will
~~be liable for diyah only. the prophet (pbuh) arranged payment of diyah
~~to the heirs of the victim in the case mentioned in this hadith because
~~some of the companions of the prophet (pbuh) had advanced the argument
~~that the murderer had slain the victim on the presumption that he had
~~professed islam just to save his life. PageV01P0490

~~from the ansar and i caught hold of a man (of the defeated tribe). when

~~this hadith with the present chapter is evident from the fact that it
~~stresses that injunctions of islam will be enforced on every muslim
~~according to his apparent condition. it is a very wise course indeed for
~~the reason that it has closed the door of retaliation; otherwise,
~~everyone could kill his enemy on the pretext that the victim was not
~~sincere in his profession of islam. in order to rule out the possibility

~~mean that man is absolutely helpless and is deprived of will and power,
~~as is believed by some deviant sects who have gone astray. fate is in
~~fact a manifestation of the knowledge of allah and it has nothing to do
~~with the will and intention of a person. allah has not created man as a
~~helpless creature, but has endowed him with the freedom of will and
~~action, because in the absence of these two qualities, there would be no
~~justification for his trial. he could only be put to test if he was
~~granted not only the ability to choose between good and evil but also
~~the freedom to act. for this purpose, almighty allah, has clearly
~~indicated to man both the paths and granted him freedom to choose
~~whichever he likes. he has also told him the ultimate end of each. the
~~noble qur'an says: "verily, we showed him the way, whether he be
~~grateful or ungrateful". (76:3) "then whosoever wills, let him believe;
~~and whosoever wills, let him disbelieve". (18:29). but by mentioning
~~this hadith in the chapter relating to the fear of allah, imam an-nawawi
~~has warned that we should be fearful of allah, pray for his help, and an
~~auspicious end of our life. he has advised us to adopt whatever means
~~are available to us. in other words, we should make faith and piety a
~~way of life because one can find the means and resources according to
~~one's capacity. since nobody knows the result of his endeavours, one
~~should leave it to allah and rest assured that he who has created him
~~with a purpose will also create the ways and means to attain it. he who
~~adopts piety, the ways to piety will open for him; and he who adopts
~~evil, the ways to evil will open for him. a muslim should never go
~~towards evil at any stage of his life, lest his life comes to an end
~~suddenly and he is deprived of the reward of all the good deeds he has
~~done during his life and consequently he is consigned to hell rather
~~than jannah. may allah save us from a bad end and such actions which
~~lead one to hell. PageV01P0496

~~this hadith also highlights the importance of fear of allah because the
~~more awareness a muslim has of the majesty and magnificence of allah,
~~the greater shall be the terror in his heart for his punishment and hope
~~of his mercy. with this state of mind, he will perform greater acts of
~~obedience and abstain more rigidly from sins. 2. the hadith also
~~mentions the heaven teeming with angels who are all the time prostrating
~~before allah in worship. when this is the condition of the angels, who

~~جسمه فيم أبلاه ] رواه الترمذي وقال حديث حسن 407. abu barzah (may allah

~~feet will not move on the day of resurrection before he is asked about
~~his life, how did he consume it, his knowledge, what did he do with it,
~~his wealth, how did he earn it and how did he dispose of it, and about
~~his body, how did he wear it out.'' [at-tirmidhi]. commentary: 1. this
~~hadith first of all highlights the importance and value of this
~~transitory life, every breath of which is invaluable. not a moment of it
~~should, therefore, be wasted in the disobedience of allah because one
~~shall also be made to account for it. 2. man shall also be answerable
~~for his knowledge. here, we find an inducement for acquiring religious
~~knowledge because that alone is beneficial for him. he should make use
~~of his knowledge for winning the pleasure of allah. if he does not do
~~that then he must think about the justification for not doing so. he
~~must also think how he would be facing allah on the day of resurrection.
~~3. the question in respect of wealth raised in this hadith clearly shows
~~that one should earn wealth by legitimate means only and spend it
~~strictly in a lawful manner. if he takes to unfair means of income or
~~squanders it, he will be sinful and required to account for the
~~violation of the divine injunctions. 4. one should protect his body from
~~everything that is unlawful and force himself to submit to the divine
~~injunctions. when he is asked to account for neglecting them, it will be
~~difficult for him to escape the consequences of accountability. in
~~short, this hadith makes one conscious of the accountability so that one
~~keeps it all the time in view so that he will be saved from humiliation
~~on the day of resurrection. how nice would it really be if one bears the
~~accountability of the day of resurrection always in mind! PageV01P0507

~~verily the commodity of allah is jannah". [at-tirmidhi]. commentary:
~~imam at-taibi has stated that the prophet (pbuh) mentioned this example
~~for travellers to the hereafter, because satan is sitting on this
~~passage and man's self and his false desires are his helpers. if a
~~person is wide-awake in his travel and exercises caution in his
~~activities, he is not only saved from the vices of satan, but his own
~~false desires also do not stand in his way. the prophet (pbuh) also
~~pointed out that the way to the hereafter is very hard and littered with
~~great impediments and obstructions and it is by no means easy to
~~traverse it. jannah is an invaluable gift and unless man gives the
~~sacrifice of his life and wealth, he will not become eligible for
~~entering it. "allah has purchased the lives and properties of muslims

~~slave and his messenger, that `isa (jesus) is his slave and messenger
~~and he (jesus) is his word which he communicated to maryam (mary) and
~~his spirit which he sent to her, that jannah is true and hell is true;
~~allah will make him enter jannah accepting whatever deeds he
~~accomplished". [al-bukhari and muslim]. another narration in muslim is:
~~the messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "whosoever testifies that there is
~~no true god except allah and that muhammad is the messenger of allah,
~~allah (swt) saves him from the fire (of hell)". commentary: this hadith
~~confirms that all prophets of allah were men and thus refutes those who
~~attribute divinity to them and exclude them from the category of men or
~~regard them a part of allah, as christians believes prophet `isa (jesus
~~to be christ) by regarding him allah or his son, or the jews do prophet
~~`uzair by venerating him as son of allah. the misconception has also
~~taken hold of a sect of the muslims. they have invented the belief that
~~prophet muhammad (pbuh) is "light from the light of allah". thus further
~~considering to be of him with divine qualities. they exclude him from
~~the category of men. this hadith tells us that the belief that prophets
~~were men constitutes part of faith and denial of it is the denial of a
~~part of faith and amounts to evasion from tauhid - oneness of allah.
~~prophet `isa (jesus) has been referred in the qur'an as "kalimatullah"
~~(the word of allah) (4:171). what these words really mean is that he was
~~born in an unusual manner, without being fathered by anyone, only on the
~~express fiat of allah. this hadith shows that a major sin does not cast
~~a muslim out of the fold of islam, as is believed by certain deviant
~~sects who have gone astray. such a person does remain a muslim and his
~~eligibility for admission into jannah also remains intact but his
~~admission entirely depends on the pleasure of allah. he may forgive a
~~sinful muslim and send him to jannah even in the initial stage or keep
~~him in hell for sometime and then send him to jannah. thus, when it is
~~said that muslims are protected against hell, it means that they will
~~not abide in hell for ever. it will be a temporary phase varying with
~~his sins. when that punishment comes to an end, or even before it, when
~~almighty, allah, wills, he will be removed from hell to jannah.

~~by one span, i will approach him by one cubit; and whosoever approaches
~~me by one cubit, i approach him by one fathom, and whosoever comes to me
~~walking, i go to him running; and whosoever meets me with an earth-load
~~of sins without associating anything with me, i meet him with
~~forgiveness like that". [muslim] commentary: this hadith mentions the
~~infinite compassion and mercy of allih to his obedient slaves and a
~~special expression of which will be made by him on the day of
~~resurrection. on that day, he will give at least ten times reward for
~~each good deed. in some cases it may be far more than that, seven
~~hundred times or more, as he would like. such benevolence on his part
~~warrants that a muslim should never lose hope of his forgiveness.

~~"o mu`adh!'' he replied, "here i am responding to you, and at your
~~pleasure, o messenger of allah.'' upon this he (the prophet (pbuh))
~~said, "if anyone testifies sincerely that there is no true god except
~~allah, and muhammad is his slave and messenger, truly from his heart,
~~allah will safeguard him from hell.'' he (mu`adh) said, "o messenger of
~~allah, shall i not then inform people of it, so that they may have glad
~~tidings.'' he (pbuh) replied, "then they will rely on it alone (and thus
~~give up good works altogether).'' mu`adh (may allah be pleased with him)
~~disclosed this hadith at the time of his death, to avoid sinning for
~~concealing. [al-bukhari and muslim]. commentary: imam at-taibi says that
~~the honesty of heart means firmness of faith and arrangement of actions
~~which will provide evidence of tauhid and risalah (oneness of allah and
~~the prophethood of muhammad (pbuh)). al-hafiz ibn hajar states that imam
~~at-taibi has made this elaboration to remove the ambiguity which arises
~~from the wording of the hadith because it is generally held by ahadith
~~that one who bears witness to tauhid and risalah will not go to hell,
~~while ahlus-sunnah hold that it stands proved by concrete arguments that
~~sinful muslims will be consigned to hell and then brought out from it by
~~intercession. it shows that for the determination of real meanings of
~~this hadith we shall have to keep in view other related arguments as
~~well. these meanings are riveted with good deeds. in other words, one
~~who bears witness to tauhid and risalah and fulfills islamic injunctions
~~and obligations and requirements of faith and fear of allah, will not be
~~consigned to hell. some scholars are of the opinion that this hadith
~~refers to such people who truly repented and renounced kufr and shirk
~~and wholeheartedly professed tauhid and risalah but died soon after that
~~and thus did not get an opportunity to do good deeds. such people will
~~certainly go to jannah. this hadith leads to the conclusion that
~~ordinary people should not be told things the true meanings of which
~~they find difficult to grasp and accomplish evil deeds relying on such
~~glad tidings. PageV01P0517

~~reported: on the day of the battle of tabuk, the muslims were hard
~~pressed by hunger and they asked messenger of allah (pbuh): "o messenger
~~of allah, grant us permission to slaughter our camels to eat and use
~~their fat". he (pbuh) accorded permission. on this `umar (may allah be
~~pleased with him) came and said: "o messenger of allah, if it is done,
~~we shall suffer from lack of transportation. i suggest you pool together
~~whatever has been left and supplicate allah to bless it.'' allah will
~~bestow his blessing upon it. messenger of allah (pbuh) agreed and called
~~for leather mat and had it spread out, and asked people to bring the
~~provisions left over. they started doing it. one brought a handful of
~~corn, another brought a handful of dates, a third brought a piece of
~~bread; thus some provisions were collected on the mat. messenger of
~~allah (pbuh) invoked blessings, and then said, "now take it up in your
~~vessels". everyone filled his vessel with food, so that there was not
~~left a single empty vessel in the whole camp. all of them ate to their
~~fill and there was still some left over. messenger of allah (pbuh) said,
~~"any slave who meets allah, testifying there is no true god except
~~allah, and that i am his messenger, without entertaining any doubt about
~~these (two fundamentals), will not be banished from entering jannah.''
~~[muslim]. commentary: this hadith mentions a miracle of the prophet
~~(pbuh) and the effect of his prayer by means of which a small quantity
~~of food sufficed the whole army. the exact number of muslims who took
~~part in the battle of tabuk is not mentioned in any reliable account.
~~al-hafiz ibn hajar has stated, with reference to some narratives of fath
~~al-bari mentioned in connection with the biography of the prophet (pbuh)
~~and the wars he had fought in the way of allah, that they numbered
~~thirty to forty thousand men. although these figures are open to
~~question but one can safely infer from these figures that their number
~~was very large. according to sahih al-bukhari: "a large number of
~~muslims participated with the prophet (pbuh) in this war. their number
~~was so large that they could not be described in a register. it was
~~difficult for the prophet (pbuh) to discover who was absent except that
~~he was informed about him by allah.'' (sahih al-bukhari, kitab al-
~~maghazi, bab ghazwah tabuk, hadith ka`b bin malik). this extract goes to
~~prove that although the number of muslims who took part in this war was
~~very large the provisions weighing a few seers only sufficed for them
~~all. we also learn from this hadith that one who is blessed with the
~~grace of allah, can offer advice to a person who is superior to him on
~~this account. similarly, the one who is superior in virtue should listen
~~to the advice of those who are inferior to him because there is every
~~possibility that their advice may offer something better. it does not
~~harm either of them. neither does it detract from the superiority of the
~~superior nor can it be regarded an affront of a junior. PageV01P0518

~~reported, who was with messenger of allah (pbuh) in the battle of badr:
~~i used to lead my people at bani salim in salat (prayer) and there was a
~~valley between me and those people. whenever it rained, it became
~~difficult for me to cross it for going to their mosque. so i went to
~~messenger of allah (pbuh) and said, "i have weak eyesight and the valley
~~between me and my people flows during the rainy season and it becomes
~~difficult for me to cross it. i wish you to come to my house and offer
~~salat at a place so that i could reserve that as a musalla (place for
~~prayer).'' messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "i will do so". so messenger
~~of allah (pbuh) and abu bakr (may allah be pleased with him) came to my
~~house the (next) morning after the sun had risen high. messenger of
~~allah (pbuh) asked my permission to enter and i admitted him. he did not
~~sit before saying, "where do you want us to offer salat in your house?''
~~i pointed to the place where i wanted him to offer prayers. so messenger
~~of allah (pbuh) stood up for the prayer and started the prayer with
~~takbir and we aligned in rows behind him; and he offered two rak`ah
~~prayer and finished them with taslim, and we also performed taslim with
~~him. i detained him for a meal called khazirah which i had prepared for
~~him. (khazirah is a special type of dish prepared from barley flour and
~~meat soup). when the neighbours got the news that messenger of allah
~~(pbuh) was in my house, they started coming till a large number of men
~~gathered in my house. one of them said, "what is wrong with malik, for i
~~do not see him?'' one of them replied, "he is a hypocrite and does not
~~love allah and his messenger". on that messenger of allah (pbuh) said,
~~"don't say this. haven't you seen that he testified that there is no
~~true god except allah,' for allah's sake only.'' the man replied, "allah
~~and his messenger know better, but by allah, we never saw him but
~~helping and talking with the hypocrites.'' messenger of allah (pbuh)
~~replied, "no doubt, whosoever testifies that there is no true god except
~~allah, seeking by so professing the pleasure of allah only, allah will
~~safeguard him against (hell) fire.'' [al-bukhari and muslim].
~~commentary: this hadith highlights the following four points: 1. one can
~~offer salat at home if one has a lawful reason for it. 2. in the event
~~one is obliged to offer salat at home it is well to reserve a place for
~~it. 3. it is not permissible to suspect a muslim on the basis of mere

~~pressed it against her belly and gave it a suck. messenger of allah

~~part creatures deal with one another with compassion, so much so that an

~~one for jinn, mankind, animals and insects, through which they love one
~~another and have compassion for one another; and through it, wild

~~of which one mercy is used by his creation for mutual love and
~~affection. ninety-nine mercies are kept for the day of resurrection.''

~~hundred units of mercy on the day he created the heavens and the earth.
~~each one of them can contain all that is between the heaven and the
~~earth. of them, he put one on earth, through which a mother has
~~compassion for her children and animals and birds have compassion for
~~one another. on the day of resurrection, he will perfect and complete
~~his mercy". (that is he will use all the hundred units of mercy for his
~~slaves on that day). commentary: 1. we learn from this hadith that kind
~~and compassionate treatment is liked by allah and is in fact his
~~blessing and benevolence. this is the reason he has given a part of it
~~to his creatures, and a person who is so hard-hearted, that he is not
~~even aware of it has a defect which is extremely displeasing to allah.
~~moreover, it is a sign that such a person is deprived of divine blessing

~~421. abu hurairah (may allah be pleased with him) reported: the prophet
~~(pbuh) said, "allah, the exalted, and glorious said: `a slave committed
~~a sin and he said: o allah, forgive my sin,' and allah said: `my slave
~~committed a sin and then he realized that he has a rubb who forgives the
~~sins and punishes for the sin.' he then again committed a sin and said:
~~`my rubb, forgive my sin,' and allah (swt) said: `my slave committed a
~~sin and then realized that he has a rubb who forgives his sin and
~~punishes for the sin.' he again committed a sin and said: `my rubb,
~~forgive my sin,' and allah (swt) said: `my slave has committed a sin and
~~then realized that he has a rubb who forgives the sin or takes (him) to
~~account for sin. i have granted forgiveness to my slave. let him do
~~whatever he likes". [al-bukhari and muslim]. the last sentence "let him
~~do..". means, as long he keeps asking for forgiveness after the
~~commission of sins, and repents, allah will forgive him because
~~repentance eliminates previous sins". (editor's note) commentary: this
~~hadith tells us that so long as the heart of a muslim remains free from
~~willful disobedience of divine injunctions and he does not deliberately
~~neglect his religious duties, that is to say he goes on committing sins
~~and each time wholeheartedly begs pardon for them, almighty, allah will
~~forgive him. the reason being that he is penitent for his wrongs and
~~does not insist upon them for fear of accountability. this condition of
~~his shows that his heart is full of awe and majesty of allah and he does
~~not feel any disgrace in showing his utter humbleness before him. now
~~this is a merit of the sinful which is pleasing to allah. thus, he says
~~that so long as his slave continues submission and prostration he will
~~go on forgiving him. on the contrary, there is a person who goes on
~~committing sins but he neither repents for them nor seeks pardon for his
~~wrongs; nor has any fear of accountability. obviously, he is altogether
~~different from the kind of muslims mentioned before, and he will be
~~therefore treated differently by allah. the conduct of the former is of
~~a muslim who, in spite of his sins, is liked by allah while the second
~~is of that of a rebel for whom he has kept severe punishment ready. may
~~allah rank us among the former category of people. PageV01P0523

~~cease to exist who neither commit sins nor seek pardon from him, he will
~~create people who will do so. it does not, however, mean that he likes
~~sins or the sinful persons. what it really means is that he likes
~~penitence and the penitents. this is the true purport of this hadith. it

~~`verily, we will please you with regard to your ummah and will never

~~clear: firstly, the kindness and mercy which the prophet (pbuh) had for
~~his ummah, a full manifestation of which will be seen on the day of
~~resurrection. secondly, the love that allah has for his prophet,

# وعن أنس رضي الله عنه عن رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم قال : [ إن

~~يدخر له حسناته في الآخرة ويعقبه رزقا في الدنيا على طاعته ] وفي رواية : [
~~إن الله لا يظلم مؤمنا حسنة يعطى بها في الدنيا ويجزي بها في الآخرة . وأما

~~accomplishes any good deed, he is rewarded for it in this world; and in
~~the case of a muslim, allah stores up his good acts for him in the
~~hereafter and provides him with subsistence in this life due to his
~~obedience.'' another narration is: messenger of allah (pbuh) said,
~~"allah does not wrong a believer a good deed because he is given
~~blessings for it in this world and will be rewarded for it in the
~~hereafter. but the infidel is given in the world the reward for good

~~hereafter, there is no good deed for which he can be rewarded".
~~[muslim]. commentary: the infidels also do in this world many works
~~which are for public welfare, or which come under the category of good
~~deeds. almighty allah gives them reward for such good deeds in this
~~world in the form of wealth, sound health, or saving them from some
~~trouble, because belief is precondition for reward in the hereafter.
~~since an infidel is deprived of it, he will also be deprived of their
~~reward in the hereafter. thus, we learn that belief constitutes the
~~basis of every action and is a precondition for the acceptance of any
~~good deed by allah. PageV01P0530

~~reported: in the pre-islamic period of ignorance, i used to think that
~~people who used to worship idols, were deviated and did not adhere to
~~the true religion. then i heard of a man in makkah who was preaching a
~~message. so i mounted my camel and went to him. i found that (this man
~~who was) messenger of allah (pbuh) remained hidden because of the
~~persecution by his people. i had entered makkah stealthily and when i
~~met him i asked him, "who are you?'' he (pbuh) said, "i am a prophet.''
~~i asked; "what is a prophet?'' he said, "allah has sent me (with a
~~message)". i asked, "with what has he sent you?'' he said, "he sent me
~~to strengthen the ties of kinship, to destroy idols so that allah alone
~~should be worshipped and nothing should be associated with him". i
~~asked, "who has followed you in this?'' he said, "a freeman and a
~~slave". (at that time only abu bakr and bilal (may allah be pleased with
~~her) were with him). i said, "i shall follow you". he said, "you can not
~~do that now. do you not see my situation and that of the people? go to
~~your people, and when you hear that my cause has prevailed, come to me".
~~so i went back to my people, and while i was with my people, messenger
~~of allah (pbuh) emigrated to al-madinah. i continued to ask people about
~~him till some of my people visited al-madinah. on their return, i asked
~~them, "how is that man who has arrived in al-madinah faring?'' they
~~said, "people are hastening to him. his own people had planned to kill
~~him but did not succeed.'' then i went to al-madinah and came to him and
~~said, "o messenger of allah, do you recognize me?'' he (pbuh) said,
~~"yes, you are the one who met me in makkah.'' i said, "o messenger of
~~allah, tell me of that which allah has taught you and of which i am
~~unaware. tell me about salat first.'' he (pbuh) replied, "perform the
~~fajr (morning) salat, then stop salat until the sun has risen up to the
~~height of a lance, for when it rises, it rises up between the horns of
~~the devil, and the infidels prostrate themselves before it at that time.
~~then perform salat, for salat is witnessed and angels attend it, until
~~the shadow becomes equal to the length of its object; then stop salat,
~~for at that time jahannam (hell) is heated up. then pray when the shadow
~~becomes longer, for the prayer is witnessed and angels attend it, until
~~you perform `asr prayer; then stop salat till sun sets, for it sets
~~between the horns of a devil. at that time the infidels prostrate
~~themselves before it.'' i then asked the messenger of allah to tell me
~~about wudu', and he (pbuh) said, "when a person begins the wudu' and
~~washes his mouth and nose, the sins committed by his face, mouth and
~~nostrils are washed out. then when he washes his face as commanded by
~~allah, the sins of his face are washed out with the water from the sides
~~of his beard. then when he washes his hands up to elbows, the sins of
~~his hands are washed out through his fingers with water. then he passes
~~his wet hands over his head and the sins of the head are washed out
~~through the ends of his hair with water. then he washes his feet up to
~~the ankles, the sins of his feet are washed out through his toes with
~~water. then, if he stands up for salat and praises allah, glorifies him,
~~proclaims his greatness as he deserves and devotes his heart wholly to
~~allah, he emerges sin free as the day he was born". when `amr bin
~~`abasah (may allah be pleased with him) narrated this hadith to abu
~~umamah (may allah be pleased with him) a companion of the prophet
~~(pbuh), the latter said to him, "watch what you are saying. o `amr bin
~~`abasah, a man will be getting all of this in one shot?'' `amr (may
~~allah be pleased with him) replied, "o abu umamah, i have attained old
~~age, my bones have become dry, my death is approaching and there is no
~~need for me to tell lies concerning allah and his messenger (pbuh). had
~~i not heard this from the messenger of allah only once, twice, thrice
~~(and he counted up to seven) i would never have reported it. indeed i
~~have heard this frequently". [muslim]. commentary: this hadith makes the
~~following seven points: 1. the preacher should be concerned about the
~~safety of his followers. it is for this reason, the prophet (pbuh)
~~stressed upon `amr bin abasah (may allah be pleased with him) to stay at
~~home and keep his conversion to islam secret. 2. no matter how
~~unfavourable are the circumstances and how tough is the opposition, a
~~preacher should always have firm hope of help from allah and be
~~confident about his victory over his enemy. that is why, the prophet
~~(may allah be pleased with him) asked `amr (may allah be pleased with
~~him) to come to him when he received information about his domination.
~~3. it is a proof of his prophethood that what eventually happened was
~~exactly according to his prophecy. 4. angels attend the salat. one
~~should, therefore, perform salat not only with peace of mind but also
~~with utmost humility and fear of allah, so that it is reported and
~~becomes more meritorious. 5. the times when salat is unpraiseworthy are
~~as follows: a. after the salat of fajr to the time of sunrise. b. at the
~~time when the sun begins to decline. c. after the salat of `asr to the
~~time of sunset. d. when the sun is rising or setting. 6. wudu' and salat
~~expiate for sins. for this reason this hadith has been mentioned in this
~~chapter. 7. even in the days of ignorance (pre-islamic period), pious
~~and right-minded people were averse to idolatry and thought it a
~~deviation from the right path PageV01P0540

~~[ إذا أراد الله رحمة أمة قبض نبيها قبلها فجعله لها فرطا وسلفا بين يديها
~~وإذا أراد هلكة أمة عذبها ونبيها حي فأهلكها وهو ينظر فأقر عينه بهلاكها

~~to show mercy to a people, he collects their prophet before them and
~~makes him a herald to happiness for them in the hereafter; and when he
~~intends to destroy a people, he punishes them while their prophet is
~~alive, and destroys them while he is alive and watches them and makes
~~him witness their destruction because they disbelieved in him and
~~disobeyed his commands". [muslim]. commentary: this hadith tells us
~~about a divine law in respect of prophets, which is meant to deter

~~good consequences, and one who does evil deeds will expect evil

~~whatever sins you have committed. o son of 'adam, i do not care if your

~~would forgive you. o son of 'adam, if you come to me with an earth load

~~really means is that if sins of a muslim, committed in ignorance and
~~carelessness, become so numerous that in stacks touch the heights of
~~skies, he should not lose hope in allah's mercy. if he repents
~~wholeheartedly for his sins, makes penitence for them and begs allah's

~~(polytheism) is an absolutely unpardonable sin. all other sins, how many

~~if he likes and send the sinful persons straight to jannah, or keep them

~~for this reason, he is superior to mus`ab bin `umair (may allah be

~~of his martyrdom and poverty through which he had passed. he holds
~~mus`ab bin `umair (may allah be pleased with him) better on the grounds
~~that he had confronted the infidels in extremely difficult circumstances
~~and sacrificed his life for the sake of allah. the second point which
~~this hadith brings out is the fear which abdur-rahman bin `auf (may
~~allah be pleased with him) felt at the abundance of wealth and property,
~~although he used to spend his wealth and riches in the way of allah and
~~jihad. today, the only purpose of our wealth is that we waste it either
~~on foolish customs and ceremonies of marriage or construction of

~~harvest, as if it had not flourished yesterday! thus, do we explain the
~~ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, laws,

~~to them the example of the life of this world: it is like the water
~~(rain) which we send down from the sky, and the vegetation of the earth
~~mingles with it, and becomes fresh and green. but (later) it becomes dry
~~and broken pieces, which the winds scatter. and allah is able to do
~~everything. wealth and children are the adornment of the life of this
~~world. but the good righteous deeds that last, are better with your rubb
~~for rewards and better in respect of hope.'' (18:45,46) "know that the
~~life of this world is only play and amusement, pomp and mutual boasting
~~among you, and rivalry in respect of wealth and children. (it is) as the

~~tiller; afterwards it dries up and you see it turning yellow; then it

~~من البحرين فسمعت الأنصار بقدوم أبي عبيدة فوافوا صلاة الفجر مع رسول الله
~~صلى الله عليه و سلم فلما صلى رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم انصرفوا
~~فتعرضوا له فتبسم رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم حين رآهم ثم قال : [ أظنكم
~~سمعتم أن أبا عبيدة قدم بشيء من البحرين ؟ ] فقالوا : أجل يا رسول الله .
~~فقال : [ أبشروا وأملوا ما يسركم فوالله ما الفقر أخشى عليكم ولكني أخشى أن

~~فتهلككم كما أهلكتهم ] متفق عليه 457. `amr bin `auf al-ansari (may allah
~~be pleased with him) reported: messenger of allah (pbuh) sent abu
~~`ubaidah bin al-jarrah (may allah be pleased with him) to bahrain to
~~collect (jizyah). so he returned from bahrain with wealth. the ansar got
~~news of it and joined with the prophet (pbuh) in the fajr prayer. when
~~the prophet (pbuh) concluded the prayer, they stood in his way. when he
~~saw them, he smiled and said, "i think you have heard about the arrival
~~of abu `ubaidah with something from bahrain". they said, "yes! o
~~messenger of allah!". he (pbuh) said, "rejoice and hope for that which
~~will please you. by allah, it is not poverty that i fear for you, but i
~~fear that this world will be opened up with its wealth for you as it was
~~opened to those before you; and you vie with one another over it as they
~~did and eventually it will ruin you as it ruined them". [muslim].
~~commentary: we learn from this hadith that, from the religious angle,
~~poverty of an individual or nation is not as dangerous as its affluence.
~~for this reason, the prophet (pbuh) cautioned his ummah against the
~~consequences of abundance of wealth and warned his followers to save
~~themselves from its evils. we witness today that all his fears have come
~~true. the excess of wealth has made the majority of rich extremely
~~careless about their religious obligations. it is this negligence and

~~fear. PageV01P0567

~~very difficult circumstances. it was intended to impress upon them the
~~need for patience and boost their morale. they were made to understand
~~that they should not be perplexed by the strenuous period they were
~~passing through because these were transitory and temporary phases of
~~life after which lay the everlasting life, the real life that was not
~~only permanent but also full of perpetual luxuries. secondly, to the
~~occasion of hajjat-ul-wada` (last hajj performed by the prophet (pbuh))
~~when he saw around him a large crowd of muslims. then he warned them
~~against becoming proud or overjoyed by their strength and power. the
~~grandeur and majesty being witnessed by them would come to an end. the
~~real life was of al-'akhirah (hereafter) and they should do their utmost
~~to reform it. PageV01P0570

~~members of his family, his property and his deeds. two of them return;
~~and one remains with him. the people and his wealth return; his deeds
~~remain with him". [al-bukhari and muslim]. commentary: this hadith has a
~~warning for the muslims that they should adopt the way of piety and fear
~~(of allah), not of sin and impiety because those are actions which will
~~go with him to the grave and which decide his fate in the life after
~~death. if he carries with him good deeds, he will have a comfortable
~~sojourn in barzakh (the intervening stage between death and
~~resurrection). on the contrary, if the record of his life is devoid of
~~good deeds, all the wealth that he leaves behind, even if it is beyond
~~calculation, will be of no avail to him because what he will be having

~~inmates of hell, a person who had led the most luxurious life in this
~~world will be brought up on the day of resurrection and dipped in the
~~fire and will be asked: `o son of adam! did you ever experience any
~~comfort? did you happen to get any luxury?' he will reply: `by allah,

~~allah, here i am responding to you". he said, "if i had as much gold as
~~the weight of uhud, it would not please me to have a single dinar out of
~~it with me after the passage of three days, but i would hold back
~~something for the repayment of a debt. i would distribute it among the
~~slaves of allah like this and like this and like this.'' and he (pbuh)
~~pointed in front of him, and on his right side and on his left side. we
~~then walked a little further and he (pbuh) said: "the rich would be poor
~~on the day of resurrection, except he who spent like this and like this
~~and like this,". and he pointed as he did the first time. "but such
~~persons are few". then he said, "stay where you are till i come back to
~~you". he (the prophet (pbuh)) walked ahead a little further in the
~~darkness of the night and disappeared from my sight. i heard a loud
~~voice. i said (to myself): "the messenger of allah might have met
~~(mishap or an enemy)". i wished i could go after him but i remembered
~~his commanding me to stay till he came back. so i waited for him; and
~~when he came, i made mention of what i had heard. he asked, "did you
~~hear it?". i said, "yes". then he said, "it was jibril (gabriel), who
~~came to me and said: `he who dies among your ummah without having
~~associated anything with allah (in worship) will enter jannah.' i said:
~~`even if he committed illicit sexual intercourse or steals?' he (jibril)
~~said: `even if he has committed illicit sexual intercourse or steals".
~~[al-bukhari and muslim]. commentary: the last portion of this hadith
~~means that a muslim, having firm faith in the oneness of allah, will go
~~to jannah even if he has committed major sins in his life. if allah
~~wills, he will be sent straight to jannah, or he will be sent there
~~after suffering punishment in hell for sometime. some scholars have
~~associated this hadith with such persons who make repentance at the time
~~when they are close to death and then they do not get time to do good or
~~bad deeds. almighty allah will pardon even their major sins without
~~giving them any punishment. this hadith also tells us that it is
~~permissible, rather essential, to reserve some money for the payment of
~~loan because its repayment is far more important than giving (voluntary
~~alms). it also mentions the piety of the prophet (pbuh) and his passion
~~for spending in the way of allah. PageV01P0575

~~look at those who are superior to you, for this will keep you from
~~belittling allah's favour to you.'' [al-bukhari and muslim]. this is the

~~allah (pbuh) said: "when one of you looks at someone who is superior to
~~him in property and appearance, he should look at someone who is
~~inferior to him". commentary: by looking at the worldly goods and riches
~~of others, a person gradually becomes unthankful for the blessings which
~~allah has bestowed on him. the best remedy for this "disease" is that
~~which has been prescribed by messenger of allah (pbuh) in this hadith.
~~the remedy is that one should look at the people who have lesser worldly
~~goods and riches than one's own. if a person has a small house of his
~~own which can protect him from the harshness of weather, then he has no
~~need to see enviously towards sky-high buildings and palatial houses of
~~others. he should look at the homeless people who spend their nights on
~~footpaths and live in huts which in rain leak like sieve and are swept
~~away by a wave of flood water, etc. but from a religious angle, one
~~should see towards those who are more fearful of allah and observe their
~~salat meticulously so that one becomes more fond of obedience of allah,
~~has a greater fear of him and devotes more time to prayer and devotion.
~~this dispensation is also given in other ahadith. PageV01P0577

# وعن أبي العباس سهل بن سعد الساعدي رضي الله عنه قال جاء رجل إلى النبي
~~صلى الله عليه و سلم فقال : يا رسول الله دلني على عمل إذا عملته احبني
~~الله وأحبني الناس . فقال : [ ازهد في الدنيا يحبك الله وازهد فيما عند
~~الناس يحبك الناس ] حديث حسن رواه ابن ماجه وغيره بأسانيد حسنة 472. sahl
~~bin sa`d as-sa`idi (may allah be pleased with him) reported: a man came
~~to the prophet (pbuh) and said, "o messenger of allah, guide me to such
~~an action which, if i do allah will love me and the people will also
~~love me.'' he (pbuh) said, "have no desire for this world, allah will
~~love you; and have no desire for what people possess, and the people
~~will love you.'' [ibn majah] commentary: "zuhd'' (ascetism) does not
~~mean renunciation of the world and obligations of life. what it really
~~means is that one should be contented with what he possess and rid
~~himself of greed. islam neither permits renunciation of the world nor
~~does it condemn genuine struggle to acquire wealth and riches.
~~therefore, involvement in worldly affairs and struggle for lawful means
~~of livelihood are not against zuhd. a person who is contented with the
~~lawful means of income is a distinguished person as all his activities
~~are exalted to the level of worship. similarly, unconcern with the
~~wealth and riches of others and ignoring them is a part of zuhd and
~~contentment. one additional advantage of it is that such a person wins
~~the love and respect of the people because he who begs people, rather
~~than allah, has to suffer disgrace and is disliked by the people. the
~~case of begging from allah is just the opposite. the more a person begs
~~him, the more pleased he will be with him. in fact, he is displeased if
~~someone does not beg him. this has been exquisitely stated in an arabic
~~verse, the meaning of which is: "do not stretch your hands before anyone
~~for your needs, but beg from him (allah) whose door is always open". "if
~~a person does not beg him (allah), he is displeased, while if one begs
~~someone he becomes furious". PageV01P0582

~~would pass his days in hunger and could not get even degraded dates to

~~account of frequent victories, he asked them to remember the early
~~period of islam in which they were poor and faced very difficult
~~circumstances, to the extent that even the prophet (pbuh) was placed in
~~the situation mentioned in this hadith. the purpose of mentioning it was
~~to warn the people against the evils of abundance of wealth and

~~for a small quantity of barley i had on a shelf and from which i kept
~~eating it for a long time. then when i measured what was left of it, it
~~soon finished. [al-bukhari and muslim]. commentary: during the last days
~~of the prophet (pbuh) the financial position of the muslims had largely
~~improved due to the spoils of war and he could have lived a comfortable
~~life if he liked, but he stuck to the same austere life which he had led
~~earlier. in this hadith, `aishah (may allah be pleased with her) has
~~related an account of the extremely austere and pious life of the
~~prophet (pbuh) although her house was the house of his most beloved
~~wife. this hadith also tells us that in spite of his profound love for
~~`aishah (may allah be pleased with him), the prophet (pbuh) did not
~~accord her any preferential treatment. he treated all his wives equally.
~~thus, this hadith has a lesson for `ulama' and their families that they
~~should not look towards worldly riches and the amenities enjoyed by them

~~three moons in two months, and a fire was not kindled in the house of

# وعن سعيد المقبري عن أبي هريرة رضي الله عنه أنه مر بقوم بين أيديهم شاة

~~الدنيا ولم يشبع من خبز الشعير . رواه البخاري [ مصلية ] بفتح الميم : أي
~~مشوية 493. abu sa`id maqburi reported: abu hurairah (may allah be
~~pleased with him) said that he happened to pass by some people who had a
~~roast lamb before them. they invited him, but he declined, saying: "the
~~messenger of allah (pbuh) left the world without having eaten his fill
~~with barley bread.'' [al-bukhari]. commentary: 1. this hadith shows how
~~much care the companions of the prophet (pbuh) exercised in following
~~him. they would even emulate him in matters in which it was not
~~obligatory under the shari`ah to follow him. it was in fact the result
~~of that extreme love that they had for the prophet (pbuh). they were not
~~like the present-day lovers of the prophet (pbuh) whose love does not go
~~beyond lip-service. they were his true lovers and they followed him
~~faithfully. 2. one should refuse to participate in feasts where
~~extravagance is displayed, as is in common practice today, so that the
~~evil tendency of extravagance and wastage is discouraged. one who avoids
~~such parties, does not refuse invitations but respects the principles
~~and values of shari`ah which is a highly meritorious act. PageV01P0605

~~the prophet (pbuh) neither ate on a dining cloth, nor ate soft bread
~~throughout his life. [al-bukhari]. one narration adds: he (pbuh) never
~~even saw a samit lamb. samit is an animal prepared for food by removing
~~its hair by boiling water, and then roasted without being skinned. this
~~type of food is preferred by wealthy people. (editor's note) commentary:
~~it means that the prophet (pbuh) has not adopted the ways of the rich

~~people. thus, he remained contented with simple food and had no relish

~~one has more honourable guests than i.'' he then went out and brought
~~them a bunch of date fruit, having dates, some still green, some ripe,
~~and some fully ripe, and requested them to eat from it. he then took his
~~knife (to slaughter a sheep). messenger of allah (pbuh) said to him, "do

~~khalid bin `umar al-`adawi reported: `utbah bin ghazwan, the governor of
~~basrah, delivered a khutbah. he praised allah, glorified him, then said:
~~"amma b`adu, verily, the world has been given the news of its end and is
~~running to meet its end swiftly. nothing is left out of it but a very
~~little amount. similar to the remainder in a dish whose owner is
~~collecting it to drink; and you are going to move to an abode which
~~knows no end, and you should proceed there with the good before you, for
~~we have been informed (by the prophet (pbuh)) that a stone would be
~~thrown at one side of the hell and it would travel down for seventy
~~years but would not reach its bottom. by allah, it will be filled (with
~~men and jinn). do you find it strange? we have been informed (i.e., by
~~the prophet (pbuh)) that the distance between two shutters of the gate
~~of jannah is forty years (distance). and a day would come when it would
~~be fully packed; i was the seventh amongst the seven who had been with
~~messenger of allah (pbuh), and we had nothing to eat but the leaves of
~~the tree until the sides of our mouth were injured. we found a sheet
~~which we tore into two and divided between myself and sa`d bin malik. i
~~made the lower garment with half of it and so did sa`d. today, there is
~~none amongst us who has not become the governor of a city, and i seek
~~refuge with allah that i should consider myself great while i am
~~insignificant to allah.'' [muslim]. commentary: this hadith brings the
~~following points into prominence: 1. remembrance of al-akhirah (the
~~hereafter) and the torment of hell. 2. description of the fast decline
~~of the world and its trend towards destruction. 3. description of the
~~vastness of jannah and hell. 4. reference to the affluence of the
~~companions of the prophet (pbuh) which they had at a subsequent stage.
~~it was in fact fulfillment of the promise of allah that he will bestow
~~upon them power and majesty in this world. 5. the description of the
~~graceful conduct of the companions of the prophet (pbuh). in spite of
~~having power and authority, they had neither arrogance nor pride.
~~goodwill and humility were special traits of their character and they
~~always sought refuge with allah against vanity and pride. 6. the
~~companions of the prophet (pbuh) had sought to gain the pleasure of

# 502. abu hurairah (may allah be pleased with him) reported: by allah
~~other than whom there is none worthy of worship, i used to press my
~~stomach against the earth owing to my hunger; i would tie a stone over
~~it. one day, i was sitting on the way they usually take when the prophet
~~(pbuh) passed by me. when he saw me he smiled at me and knew my
~~condition and my feelings. he called me and i replied, "at your service,
~~o messenger of allah.'' he said, "follow me.'' so i followed him. having
~~arrived at home, he sought permission and entered. he allowed me in and
~~i, too, entered. he found milk in a bowl and asked, "where is this
~~from?'' he was told that it was a gift for him from so-and-so. he called
~~me and i responded: "at your service, o messenger of allah.'' he said,
~~"go to the people of as-suffah and usher them in.'' he abu hurairah (may
~~allah be pleased with him) explained: the people of as-suffah were
~~guests of islam; they had no family, no property and no relations. when
~~messenger of allah (pbuh) used to receive something in charity, he would
~~send it to them without taking anything from it. when he received a
~~present, he would send for them and share it with them. on this
~~occasion, i disliked to give them anything. i said to myself: "this
~~meagre quantity of milk will not be enough for all the people of as-
~~suffah! i am more deserving of it than anyone else. by drinking it i may
~~attain some strength. when they come, he will order me to give it to
~~them. i do not expect that anything will be left for me from this
~~milk.'' as there was no alternative but to obey allah and his messenger
~~(pbuh). i went and called them. they came and sought permission which
~~was granted. they took their seats. the prophet (pbuh) called me and i
~~responded, "at your service, o messenger of allah.'' he then said, "take
~~the milk and give it to them.'' i took the bowl and gave it to one man
~~who drank his fill and returned it to me, and i gave it to the next and
~~he did the same. i went on doing this till the bowl reached messenger of
~~allah (pbuh). by that time all had taken their fill. he (pbuh) took the
~~bowl, put it on his hand, looked at me, smiled and said, "abu hirr.'' i
~~said, "at your service, o messenger of allah.'' he said, "now you and i
~~are left.'' i said, "that is true, o messenger of allah.'' he said, "sit
~~down and drink.'' i drank, but he went on saying, "drink some more.'' i
~~said, "by him who has sent you with the truth, i have no room for it.''
~~he said, "then give it to me.'' so i gave him the bowl. he praised
~~allah, uttered the name of allah and drank the remainder. [al-bukhari].
~~commentary: first, this hadith indicates the miracle of the prophet
~~(pbuh) as well as his love and compassion for ahlus-suffah, i.e., those
~~poor people who used to stay at as-suffah. second, the prophet (pbuh)
~~would not accept charity, but only gifts. third, he would also let
~~others share a gift given to him by somebody. fourth, as seen in this
~~incident, the leftovers of a muslim, whether food or drink, is
~~permissible to others to consume. fifth, to persuade a guest to eat or
~~drink more is commendable. sixth, to eat or drink to one's fill, without
~~extravagance, is also permissible PageV01P0614

~~not be called upon to testify; they will betray the trust, and will not
~~be trusted. they will make vows but will not fulfill them, and obesity
~~will prevail among them.'' [al-bukhari and muslim]. commentary: in this
~~hadith, three eras have been called as the best of ages in a graded
~~order: first, the prophetic era, second, the successors' era, and third,
~~the followers of the successors' era. goodness and religion collectively
~~prevailed during this time. then gradually there was an overall
~~deterioration and every new era that the pass of time brought it, proved
~~to be worse than the preceding one. today's muslims have fallen due to
~~their weakness in character. now, the majority of muslims lack morals
~~and belief as described in the qur'an and the hadith. the complaint is
~~to be lodged only with allah! PageV01P0621

# وعن أبي أمامة رضي الله عنه قال قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم : [
~~يا ابن آدم إنك أن تبذل الفضل خير لك وإن تمسكه شر لك ولا تلام على كفاف
~~وابدأ بمن تعول ] رواه الترمذي وقال حديث حسن صحيح 510. abu umamah (may
~~allah be pleased with him) reported: messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "o
~~son of adam, if you spend the surplus, it will be better for you; and if
~~you retain it, it will be evil for you. you will not be reprimanded for
~~storing what is enough for your need. first of all spend upon those who
~~are your dependents.'' [at-tirmidhi]. commentary: the muslims have been
~~allowed, rather emphatically told and commanded, to possess as much
~~wealth as could meet their personal and family needs. yet, they have
~~also been advised to spend the spare money on the needy. man has been
~~told that it is unwise on his part to be niggardly about money because
~~it spawns unfavourable results in this world as well as in the
~~hereafter. the concentration of wealth within a few hands freezes its
~~vitality and leads to corruption in society. as for the hereafter, the
~~result of stinginess will be definitely bad as the qur'an says: "the
~~things which they covetously withheld shall be tied to their necks like
~~a collar on the day of resurrection.'' (3:180) some `ulama' are of the
~~opinion that after the payment of the annual zakat (poor-due), it is not
~~necessary to spend more. but to be accurate, if somebody pays zakat and
~~yet retains enough money with him, and there are some needy people also
~~in his knowledge, then he will be bound to spend on them. at-tirmidhi
~~quoted a hadith in which messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "indeed there
~~is a right (for poor) in the wealth in addition to zakat.'' PageV01P0622

# وعن عبيد الله بن محصن الأنصاري الخطمي رضي الله عنه قال قال رسول الله
~~صلى الله عليه و سلم : [ من أصبح منكم آمنا في سربه معافى في جسده عنده قوت
~~يومه فكأنما حيزت له الدنيا بحذافيرها ] رواه الترمذي وقال حديث حسن [ سربه
~~] بكسر السين المهملة : أي نفسه . وقيل : قومه 511. `ubaidullah bin mihsan
~~al-ansari (may allah be pleased with him) reported: messenger of allah
~~(pbuh) said, "whosoever begins the day feeling family security and good
~~health; and possessing provision for his day is as though he possesed
~~the whole world.'' [at-tirmidhi]. commentary: to have one-day food and
~~to enjoy peace and health is indeed a great blessing. it may be said
~~that one has the same satisfaction which one can have on getting the
~~whole world. and if one lacks peace and health, the treasures of the
~~whole world will be of no use because the heaps of wealth cannot provide
~~peace of mind to one, nor can it make one enjoy sound health. the hadith
~~also implies an advice to man that instead of running after wealth, he
~~should endeavour to seek patience and contentment which alone can
~~guarantee him peace and satisfaction. otherwise, he is likely to stake
~~everything on the pursuit of this mirage. PageV01P0623

# وعن عبد الله بن عمرو بن العاص رضي الله عنهما أن رسول الله صلى الله
~~عليه و سلم قال : [ قد أفلح من أسلم وكان رزقه كفافا وقنعه الله بما آتاه ]
~~رواه مسلم 512. `abdullah bin `amr bin al-`as (may allah be pleased with
~~them) reported: messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "successful is the one
~~who enters the fold of islam and is provided with sustenance which is
~~sufficient for his day's needs, and allah makes him content with what he
~~has bestowed upon him.'' [muslim]. commentary: the real success of a man
~~will be measured by his being blessed with divine mercy and forgiveness
~~in the hereafter, and this is contingent on islam alone. if he lacks the
~~wealth of islam, all the worldly possessions will not ensure his success
~~in the next world. this hadith tells us that richness is not to be
~~defined in terms of a lot of belongings, and that the real richness is
~~gauged by the contentment of the soul. PageV01P0624

~~say: "happiness is due to him who is guided to islam and possesses
~~provision that suffices him for his day and remains content.'' [at-
~~tirmidhi]. commentary: the word tuba (translated here as happiness) is
~~given to jannah. some ahadith say that it is the name of a heavenly tree
~~as well. lexically, however, it means greeting and good tiding. the
~~sense of this hadith is analogous to that of the previous one.

~~hungry for several successive nights, nor did his family have a thing
~~for supper for many consecutive nights; and their bread was mostly of

# وعن فضالة بن عبيد رضي الله عنه أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم كان
~~إذا صلى بالناس يخر رجال من قامتهم في الصلاة من الخصاصة وهم أصحاب الصفة

~~انصرف إليهم فقال : [ لو تعلمون ما لكم عند الله تعالى لأحببتم أن تزدادوا
~~فاقة وحاجة ] رواه الترمذي وقال حديث صحيح [ الخصاصة ] : الفاقة والجوع
~~الشديد 515. fadalah bin `ubaid (may allah be pleased with him) reported:
~~when messenger of allah (pbuh) led salat, some people would fall down
~~from their standing posture out of extreme hunger. they were of the
~~people of as-suffah. the nomad arabs would say that they were insane.
~~after concluding salat, messenger of allah (pbuh) would turn to them and
~~say, "if you were to know what is in store for you with allah, the
~~exalted, you would wish to augment your starvation and lack of
~~provisions.'' [at-tirmidhi]. commentary: the habit of maintaining self-
~~respect in the period of studentship makes man self-respecting, patient
~~and content throughout his life. the dignity of `ulama' lies in
~~patience, contentment and indifference and not in wishing to drain the
~~purses of others and asking them for alms. PageV01P0627

~~التقحل ] فبالقاف والحاء قال أهل اللغة : المتقحل هو : الرجل اليابس الجلد

~~mentioned the life of the world before him. he (pbuh) said, "do you not
~~hear? do you not hear? simplicity (in life) is part of faith, simplicity
~~is part of faith.'' [abu dawud]. commentary: this hadith invites our
~~attention to a simple way of living - ordinary dress and simple and non-
~~rich food - and discourages us from being habitual of an affected life
~~style - use of costly dress, delicious and rich food and other dainties
~~of life. the more a man shuns the trappings and accessories of life, the
~~better engaged will he be in being readied for the hereafter. the
~~increased degree of his involvement in worldly comforts and luxuries
~~will keep decreasing his concern for the accountability of future life.
~~we may keep it in mind that simplicity does not mean escape from
~~cleanliness. because cleanliness is in itself `half the faith'. how can

# 518. jabir bin `abdullah (may allah be pleased with them) reported:
~~messenger of allah (pbuh) sent us in an expedition under the command of
~~abu `ubaidah (may allah be pleased with him) to intercept a caravan of
~~the quraish. he provided us with a bag of dates, apart from which he
~~found nothing for us. abu `ubaidah (may allah be pleased with him) gave
~~each of us one date (every day). he (the narrator) was asked: "what did
~~you do with that?'' he said: we sucked that just like a baby and then
~~drank water over that, and it was sufficient for us for the day until
~~night. we beat off leaves with the help of our sticks, then drenched
~~them with water and ate them. we then went to the seaside, when there
~~appeared before us something like a big mound. we came near it and we
~~found that it was a beast called al-anbar. abu 'ubaidah (may allah be
~~pleased with him) said: "it is dead (so it useless for us).'' he then
~~said: "no (but it does not matter), we have been sent by messenger of
~~allah (pbuh) in the way of allah and you are hard-pressed (on account of
~~the scarcity of food), so you can eat that.'' we, three hundred in
~~number, stayed there for a month until we fattened up (having plenty to
~~eat of that fish). he (jabir) said: i saw how we extracted pitcher after
~~pitcher full of fat from the cavity of its eye, and sliced from it
~~compact piece of meat equal to a bull or almost like a bull. abu
~~'ubaidah (may allah be pleased with him) called thirteen men from us and
~~he made them sit in the cavity of its eye, and he held one of its ribs
~~and raised it erect and then saddled the biggest of the camels we had
~~with us and it passed through it (the arched rib), and we carried large
~~pieces of meat for use in our journey. when we came back to al-madinah
~~we went to messenger of allah (pbuh) and told him about that, whereupon
~~he said, "that was a sustenance allah had brought forth for you. do you
~~have any piece of meat left with you, for us to eat.'' jabir (may allah
~~be pleased with him) said: we sent to messenger of allah (pbuh) some of
~~that (meat) and he ate it. [muslim]. commentary: this hadith also points
~~to the economic pinch from which the companions suffered in the early
~~phase of islam. they braved it patiently. secondly, the blessing came to
~~them in the sense that each one of them was patient enough to live on a
~~single date-fruit and water in twenty-four hours. thirdly, it emphasizes
~~that according to the circumstances, there is always room for ijtihad
~~(independent juristic reasoning). first abu 'ubaidah (may allah be
~~pleased with him) hesitated, but later he established a different
~~opinion on the basis of his ijtihad and decided to use the body of the
~~giant fish as food. fourthly, it provides us a proof of the sacrifice of
~~the companions that allah miraculously granted them such a huge sea-fish
~~that a group of three hundred people kept eating for one month. fifthly,
~~it tells us that a sea-carrion is a lawful food as indicated in another
~~hadith: "the water of the sea and its carrion are both halal.'' sixthly,
~~this particular fish, like the whale, is a gigantic phenomenon which is
~~normally about 50 feet long.'' PageV01P0630

# 520. jabir (may allah be pleased with him) reported: on the day of the
~~battle of al-khandaq (the trench), we were digging the trench when a
~~very hard boulder came in our way. the companions went to messenger of
~~allah (pbuh) and told him about it. he said, "i will go down the trench
~~to see it.'' he stood up and it was noticed that he had tied a stone
~~over his stomach due to intense hunger. we had not tasted anything for
~~three days. he took up a spade and struck the hard rock with it and it
~~turned into sand. i sought his permission to go home, (after reaching
~~home i) said to my wife, "i have seen the prophet (pbuh) in a state that
~~i am unable to endure. have you got anything in the house?'' she said,
~~"i have a small quantity of barley and a lamb.'' i slaughtered the lamb,
~~ground the barley and put the meat in the cooking pot. then i went to
~~the prophet (pbuh). in the meantime the flour had been kneaded and the
~~meat in the pot was nearly cooked. i said to him, "o messenger of allah,
~~i have some food, will you come along with one or two companions?'' he
~~asked, "how many men should go there?'' i told him the number. he said,
~~"it will be better if they are more in number. tell your wife not to
~~remove the pot from the hearth nor the bread from the oven till i
~~arrive.'' then he said to the muhajirun and the ansar: "let us go (to
~~eat).'' they all rose (and went with him). i went to my wife and said,
~~"bless you, the prophet (pbuh), the muhajirun, the ansar and the whole
~~company are coming.'' she said, "did he (pbuh) ask you?'' i replied in
~~the affirmative. (when they arrived) messenger of allah (pbuh) said to
~~his companions, "enter, but do not crowd in.'' then he started breaking
~~up the bread and putting meat on it. he would take from the pot and the
~~oven then would cover them up, approach his companions and hand it over
~~to them. he would then go back and uncover the pot and the oven. he
~~continued to break up the bread and put meat on it till all had eaten to
~~their fill and still some of the food remained. then he said to my wife,
~~"eat from it, and send it as a present, for the people have been
~~afflicted with severe hunger.'' [al-bukhari and muslim]. another
~~narration is: jabir said: when the trench was being dug, i noticed the
~~signs of hunger on the face of the prophet (pbuh). i returned to my wife
~~and said to her, "have you got anything in the house? i have seen the
~~signs of severe hunger on the face of messenger of allah (pbuh).'' she
~~brought out a bag which contained a sa` (a measure that equals
~~approximately 3kg.) of barley. we had a lamb which was reared in the
~~home. i slaughtered the lamb and she ground the flour for baking bread.
~~i then cut the meat and put it in the cooking pot. when i was returning
~~to messenger of allah (pbuh), my wife said to me, "do not embarass me
~~before messenger of allah (pbuh) and his companions.'' (she said this
~~because she thought that the food would not be enough for everyone, for
~~how can very little food cater for a thousand people?) when i came to
~~him, i said to him in a low tone, "o messenger of allah (pbuh), we have
~~slaughtered a small lamb and have ground a sa` of barley. please
~~accompany me with a few of your companions.'' thereupon he (pbuh)
~~announced in a loud voice, "o people of the trench, jabir has arranged a
~~feast for you, so all of you are welcome.'' and addressing me he said,
~~"do not take the pot off the fire, nor bake the kneaded flour till i
~~arrive.'' so i came home and he came ahead of the people. my wife said,
~~"it will be a matter of disgrace for you (because there is not enough
~~food).'' i said, "i did only what you told me.'' she brought out the
~~kneaded flour and messenger of allah (pbuh) spat into it, and invoked
~~the blessing of allah on it, and then he spat into the cooking pot and
~~invoked the blessing of allah on it. then he said, "call another woman
~~to help bake bread and let her take out from the cooking pot, but do not
~~take it off the fire.'' there were about a thousand guests. all of them
~~ate till they left the food and went off. our pot still bubbled as
~~before and the dough was being baked as before. commentary: this hadith
~~throws light on the simple life style which the prophet (pbuh) and his
~~companions led. it also throws light on the miracle of the augmentation
~~of food. besides, it highlights the humbleness of the prophet (pbuh)
~~that he, side by side with his companions, also did hard and arduous
~~jobs. also we are informed that it is preferable to make an offering,
~~particularly to a needy and hungry person. PageV01P0632

~~them whereupon messenger of allah (pbuh) asked, "has abu talhah sent
~~you?'' i said, "yes.'' thereupon he said to those who were with him to
~~get up (and follow him). he went forth and so did i, ahead of them until
~~i came to abu talhah and informed him. abu talhah said, "o umm sulaim,
~~here comes messenger of allah (pbuh) along with the people and we do not
~~have enough (food) to feed them.'' she said, "allah and his messenger
~~know better.'' abu talhah went out (to receive him) until he met
~~messenger of allah (pbuh), and he came forward along with him until they
~~both (messenger of allah (pbuh) and abu talhah (may allah be pleased
~~with him) came in. then messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "o umm sulaim,
~~bring forth what you have with you.'' so she brought the bread.
~~messenger of allah (pbuh) commanded that the bread be broken into small
~~pieces and after umm sulaim (may allah be pleased with her) had squeezed
~~clarified butter out of a butter container and made it just like soup.
~~messenger of allah (pbuh) recited over it what allah wished him to
~~recite. he then said, "allow ten guests to come in.'' they ate until
~~they had their fill. they then went out. he (messenger of allah (pbuh))
~~again said, "allow ten (more to come in)'', and he (the host) ushered
~~them in. they ate to their fill. then they went out. he (pbuh) again
~~said, "allow ten (more),'' until all the people ate to their fill. they
~~were seventy or eighty persons. [al-bukhari and muslim]. another
~~narration is: anas said: when all had eaten, the remaining food was
~~collected. it was as much as there was in the beginning. yet another
~~narration is: anas said: the groups of ten people ate by turn. after
~~eighty persons had eaten, messenger of allah (pbuh) and the family of
~~that house ate, and there was still a quantity left over. another
~~narration is: anas (may allah be pleased with him) said: i visited
~~messenger of allah (pbuh) one day, and found him sitting in the company
~~of his companions, with a belt tied over his waist. i asked, "why has
~~messenger of allah (pbuh) tied the belt on his waist?'' i was told, "due
~~to hunger.'' i went to abu talhah (may allah be pleased with him) the
~~husband of umm sulaim (may allah be pleased with her) and said, "o
~~father, i have seen messenger of allah (pbuh) with a belt tied over his
~~waist. i asked one of his companions about the reason of it and he said
~~that it was on account of severe hunger.'' abu talhah (may allah be
~~pleased with him) went to my mother and asked, "have you got anything?''
~~she said, "yes. i have a piece of bread and some dry dates. were
~~messenger of allah (pbuh) to come alone, we could feed him his fill, but
~~if he comes along with others, there would not be enough food.'' anas
~~then narrated the hadith in full. commentary: this hadith mentions the
~~same things we have seen in the previous one. yet, in this latter one,
~~there is an elucidation that the prophet (pbuh) and the host-family took
~~meal after everybody had taken it. imam an-nawawi said: this shows that
~~it is desirable that hosts should take meal after guests have taken it.
~~secondly, anas (may allah be pleased with him) addressed abu talhah (may
~~allah be pleased with him) as father and he did so out of respect. abu
~~talhah (may allah be pleased with him) was the step-father of anas (may
~~allah be pleased with him). his real father was malik bin an-nadir and
~~mother was umm sulaim (may allah be pleased with him). she embraced
~~islam but her husband remained a non-believer. he left his muslim wife
~~and migrated to syria where he died. afterwards she married abu talhah
~~(may allah be pleased with him). thirdly, the events of ascetic,
~~contented and destitute life as experienced by the prophet (pbuh) and
~~his companions are unthinkable today. but these are such facts, reported
~~most authentically, as can be hardly refuted by being labelled as myths.
~~yet, some scholars say that it was a particular phase of time when there
~~existed a conflict between islam and paganism. it demanded that muslims,
~~by being indifferent to the world and its comforts, should be engaged
~~day and night in uprooting disbelief, and paving the way for the
~~predominance of islam. PageV01P0633

~~commentary: self-sufficiency means that man lives on whatever he

~~entered the fold of islam and is provided with sustenance which is
~~sufficient for his needs, and allah makes him content with what he has

~~independent subsistence (kafaf) has been counted a merit by the prophet
~~(pbuh) because this prevents one from begging of people. the hadith
~~points out the excellence of those people who remain satisfied with
~~their limited resources and do not beg of people. similarly, autarky has
~~its own merit because affluence often makes a man proud, whereas penury
~~lowers his image in the eyes of people. yet adequate livelihood has no

~~قال حكيم فقلت : يا رسول الله والذي بعثك بالحق لا أرزأ أحدا بعدك شيئا حتى

~~(may allah be pleased with him) reported: i begged messenger of allah
~~(pbuh) and he gave me; i begged him again and he gave me. i begged him
~~again and he gave me and said, "o hakim, wealth is pleasant and sweet.
~~he who acquires it with self-contentment, it becomes a source of
~~blessing for him; but it is not blessed for him who seeks it out of
~~greed. he is like one who goes on eating but his hunger is not
~~satisfied. the upper hand is better than the lower one.'' i said to him,
~~"o messenger of allah, by him who sent you with the truth i will not,
~~after you, ask anyone for anything till i leave this world.'' so abu
~~bakr (may allah be pleased with him) would summon hakim (may allah be
~~pleased with him) to give his rations, but he would refuse. then 'umar
~~(may allah be pleased with him) would call him but he would decline to
~~accept anything. so 'umar (may allah be pleased with him) said
~~addressing muslims: "o muslims, i ask you to bear testimony that i offer
~~hakim his share of the booty that allah has assigned for him but he
~~refuses my offer.'' thus hakim did not accept anything from anyone after
~~the death of messenger of allah (pbuh), till he died. [al-bukhari and

~~and there comes no point of termination to this process. rather, the

~~being crazy for it, ethics certainly allows him to do so. PageV01P0638

~~some booty or prisoners of war were brought to messenger of allah (pbuh)
~~and he distributed them, giving some men and neglecting others. then, he
~~was informed that those whom he had not given a thing were displeased.
~~on this the messenger of allah (pbuh) praised allah and glorified him
~~and said, "it is a fact that i give to one and overlook another. the one
~~i ignore is dearer to me than the one i give. i give to those in whose
~~hearts i perceive anxiety; others i leave with the richness and
~~contentment that allah has put in their hearts. one of them is `amr bin
~~taghlib.'' upon this `amr bin taghlib said, "by allah i shall not accept
~~a herd of red camels in exchange for what the prophet said (about me).''
~~[al-bukhari]. commentary: whatever voluntary gifts or the spoils of war
~~were brought to messenger of allah (pbuh), he divided them out to the
~~companions. in distribution, he weighed different considerations in his
~~mind and the beneficiaries were categorized into three groups: the
~~needy, the deserving cases and those whose hearts were to be won over.
~~his primary concern, however, was to make donations to only those people
~~about whom he had apprehensions that, if ignored, they would display
~~impatience and weakness. in this way the reliable and contented type of
~~men were intentionally ignored. the superiority of `amr bin taghlib (may
~~allah be pleased with him) is determined by the fact that the prophet
~~(pbuh) counted him among the latter, and he rightly took it as a great
~~honour for him. hence, we conclude that a ruler enjoys powers of
~~expediency with regard to doling out from the public treasury. yet, he
~~is supposed to carry into practice what is implied by piety, integrity
~~and trustworthiness. he must not be subordinate to self interests.

~~attention. first, there is an account of the exemplary character of the
~~companions who became unmindful of their own needs when they saw that
~~somebody else was more needy and deserved assistance. second, there is
~~an allowance for accepting a gift provided one's heart is free from
~~desire for it. third, a man is allowed to accumulate wealth but on the
~~condition that he would fulfill his personal and family needs. besides,
~~he should resolve that he would also spend money on the needy as well as
~~on the lines approved by allah so as to win his pleasure. PageV01P0653

~~prophet (pbuh) and he gave him a herd of sheep scattered between two
~~mountains. when he returned to his people, he said to them: "o my
~~people! embrace islam because muhammad gives like one who has no fear of
~~poverty.'' some people would embrace islam only for worldly gains, but
~~soon islam becomes dearer to them than the world with all what it
~~contains. [muslim]. commentary: in this hadith, there is a provision of
~~giving economic aid to converts to win over their hearts so that their
~~loyalty to islam is firmly established. the result of this sensible
~~policy was that if somebody had embraced islam for the sake of gaining
~~material gains, this sentiment, in due course of time, would be stripped
~~off from his heart, and finally he would turn into a sincere muslim. in
~~view of its rationale, allah has termed the policy of reconciling
~~hearts, to islam as a zakat expenditure. in other words, an allocated
~~sum of the zakat fund can be expended on this head as well. some
~~scholars argue that it is now no more permissible to spend on this head.
~~but to be accurate, expending out of the zakat fund on this head is
~~valid for all times. if a measure is adequately taken on an
~~institutional basis to make the hearts of converts incline to islam, we

~~augments the honour of a man who endures an oppression patiently. (3) he
~~who opens a gate of begging, allah opens a gate of poverty (or he said a

~~whom allah has bestowed wealth and knowledge and so he fears his rubb in
~~respect to them, joins the ties of blood relationship and acknowledges
~~the rights of allah on him (and fulfills them); this type will have the
~~best position (in jannah). (2) one upon whom allah has conferred
~~knowledge but no wealth, and he is sincere in his intention and says:
~~`had i possessed wealth, i would have acted like so-and-so.' if that is
~~his intention, his reward is the same as that of the other. (3) one whom
~~allah has given wealth but no knowledge and he squanders his wealth
~~ignorantly, does not fear allah in respect to it, does not discharge the
~~obligations of kinship and does not acknowledge the rights of allah.
~~such a person will be in the worst position (in the hereafter). (4) one

# وعن أبي هريرة أنه سمع رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم يقول : [ مثل
~~البخيل والمنفق كمثل رجلين عليهما جنتان من حديد من ثديهما إلى تراقيهما .
~~فأما المنفق فلا ينفق إلا سبغت أو وفرت على جلده حتى تخفي بنانه وتعفو أثره
~~. وأما البخيل فلا يريد أن ينفق شيئا إلا لزقت كل حلقة مكانها فهو يوسعها
~~فلا تتسع ] متفق عليه [ الجنة ] : الدرع ومعناه : أن المنفق كلما أنفق سبغت
~~وطالت حتى تجر وراءه وتخفي رجليه وأثر مشيه وخطواته 560. abu hurairah (may
~~allah be pleased with him) reported: i heard messenger of allah (pbuh)
~~saying: "the case of a miserly man and a generous man who gives in
~~charity is similar to that of two persons who are clad in armour from
~~their breasts up to their collar bones. when the generous man gives in
~~charity, his armour expands so much as to cover his fingertips and toes.
~~when the miser intends to spend something the armour contracts and every
~~ring of it sticks to the place where it is (sinks into his flesh). he
~~tries to loosen it but it does not expand.'' [al-bukhari and muslim].
~~commentary: the hadith metaphorically highlights the significance of
~~giving in charity, saying it covers up a man's sins in such way as a
~~full coat of mail, reaching his feet, conceals his whole body. aside
~~from it, there is a good news for the almsgiver that his wealth will
~~receive divine blessing and he will be safe from trials and
~~tribulations. whereas a miser faces a warning that his sins and defects
~~will be made known to people and not concealed from them, and he will
~~remain the target of miseries. we are further told that when a generous
~~man intends to give charity, his chest expands for it and he happily
~~gives vent to his generosity. on the other hand, when a niggardly man
~~intends to spend money in charity, his chest contracts and he withholds
~~his giving hand. to conclude, this hadith brings good news to generous
~~people, and a warning to misers. PageV01P0680

~~man was walking through a barren land, he heard a voice coming out of a
~~cloud saying: `irrigate the garden of so-and-so.' thereupon the cloud
~~drifted in a certain direction and discharged its water over a rocky
~~plain. the streamlets flowed into a channel. this man followed the
~~channel until it reached a garden and he saw the owner of the garden
~~standing in its center, working with his spade spreading the water
~~(changing the course of the water). he asked him: "o slave of allah,
~~what is your name?'' he told his name, which was the same that he heard
~~from the cloud. the owner of the garden then asked him: "o slave of
~~allah, why did you ask my name?'' he replied: "i heard a voice from a
~~cloud which poured down this water saying: `irrigate the garden of so-
~~and-so.' i would like to know what do you do with it.'' he said: "now
~~that you asked me, i will tell you. i estimate the produce of the garden

~~and my family and invest one-third back into the garden.'' [muslim].
~~commentary: this hadith, besides the virtue of alms and charity, touches
~~upon the theme of clairvoyance and miracles. it is something supernormal
~~that a man should hear a voice from the cloud. yet such supernatural
~~phenomenon signify only the omnipotence of allah. nobody is presumed to

~~abu sa`id al-khudri (may allah be pleased with him) reported: once we

~~began looking right and left. messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "whoever
~~has an extra mount should offer it to him who is without it, and whoever
~~has surplus food should give it to him who has nothing;'' and he
~~continued mentioning other properties until we thought that none of us

~~life, particularly in a period of crisis, the muslims should adopt a co-
~~operative, consolatory and sympathetic attitude towards one another,

~~i asked him for it so that it might be my shroud after my death.'' sahl
~~(the narrator of this hadith) said: and in fact it was used as his
~~shroud. [al-bukhari]. commentary: first, the hadith is suggestive of
~~accepting a present because the exchange of presents increases mutual
~~love. messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "offer presents to each other as
~~these generate mutual love.'' second, the prophet (pbuh) would never
~~turn down anyone asking for something. third, it is permissible to get a
~~thing prepared to meet a future need. fourth, we are allowed to receive
~~a benediction from the pious ones as the companions did in case of those
~~things which had touched the blessed body of messenger of allah (pbuh).
~~yet, today the benedictory sanction is being misapplied by people. for
~~example, the washing of graves is erroneously taken to be a sacred act.
~~whereas, going by the islamic law, there is no room for the concretion
~~of a grave, still less of washing it. rather this act is unclean and
~~sacrilegious. similarly, we see some half-mad and insane people bereft
~~of the sense of purity and cleanliness. yet, the masses consider them to
~~be ecstatics and even try to seek benediction from them. as a matter of
~~fact, such lunatics are totally unconscious of the obligations of islam,
~~rather everything else. but the sanity of a man becomes questionable if
~~he considers them saints. also there are places where some relics,

~~commentary: the shari`ah rule says that in order to distribute something

~~side. in the said incident, ibn `abbas (may allah be pleased with them)
~~then a young boy, was sitting on the right side, while the aged people
~~were sitting on the left side. regard for the age difference demanded
~~that the beginning should have been made from the side of the latter.
~~but the correct way was that the beginning should be made from ibn
~~`abbas (may allah be pleased with them) because he was sitting on the
~~right side. for this reason, the prophet (pbuh) did not ignore his right
~~of priority due to his young age, rather by seeking his permission he
~~made it clear that priority should be given to a rightful person,
~~irrespective of the fact that he happened to be a child. on the other
~~hand, it was also essential for ibn `abbas (may allah be pleased with

~~drink of the prophet (pbuh) had touched his blessed mouth and this fact
~~prompted ibn `abbas i(may allah be pleased with them) to take lead in
~~benefiting from the benediction. he, therefore, preferred the prophetic
~~benediction to showing respect to the aged. the hadith throws light on

~~ahadith permit us to envy (in the positive sense of the word: see
~~commentary on the previous hadith) only two traits of character of
~~somebody. grammatically, the texts of these ahadith imply both feminine
~~and masculine genders. in the preceding hadith, the word 'knowledge' has
~~been used. it stands for the word of allah. to apply and teach knowledge
~~means to put into practise the teachings of the qur'an. and that
~~includes the recitation of the qur'an (both in salat and otherwise),
~~imparting its teaching and passing judgements in its light. from this
~~point of view both the ahadith convey the similar sense, and similarly
~~we may also read into them two persons or two traits of character.

# وعن أبي هريرة رضي الله عنه أن فقراء المهاجرين أتوا رسول الله صلى الله

~~: [ وما ذاك ؟ ] فقالوا : يصلون كما نصلي ويصومون كما نصوم ويتصدقون ولا

~~الأموال الكثيرة والله أعلم 573. abu hurairah (may allah be pleased with
~~him) reported: some of the poor emigrants came to messenger of allah
~~(pbuh) and said to him, "the wealthy have obtained all high ranks and
~~everlasting bliss.'' he asked, "how is that?'' they replied: "they offer
~~salat as we do, and observe saum (fasting) as we do, but they give in
~~sadaqah (charity) and we do not, and they emancipate slaves and we
~~cannot.'' he (pbuh) said, "shall i not teach you something whereby you
~~will catch up with those who have preceded you and will get ahead of
~~those who follow you, and no one will surpass you unless he does the
~~same as you do?'' they said, "surely, o messenger of allah.'' he said,
~~"say: subhan allah, and allahu akbar, and praise him (by saying al-hamdu
~~lillah) thirty-three times at the end of every salat.'' they returned to
~~him and said: "our brothers, the possessors of wealth, having heard what
~~we are doing, have started doing the same.'' messenger of allah (pbuh)
~~said, "this is grace of allah which he gives to whom he wishes.'' [al-
~~bukhari and muslim]. commentary: the wording of the hadith apparently
~~reveals that subhan allah "glory be to allah'', al-hamdu lillah "praise
~~be to allah'', and aallhu akbar "allah is the greatest'' should be
~~recited thirty-three times. if each group of words is said eleven times,
~~the total number will become thirty-three. but al-hafiz ibn hajar
~~believes that each formula should be uttered thirty-three times, that is
~~to say, after each prayer "subhan allah'', "al-hamdu lillah'' and
~~"allahu akbar'' should be uttered thirty-three times each. but according
~~to some ahadith, imam an-nawawi is of the view that "allahu akbar''
~~should be said thirty-four times and in the end "la ilaha illallahu
~~wahdahu la sharika lahu, lahul-mulku wa lahul-hamdu, wa huwa `ala kulli
~~shai'in qadir'' (none has the right to be worshipped but allah, he is
~~one; he has no partners; to him belongs the dominion and all the praise;
~~and he has power over all things) should be recited. should we recite
~~them together or separately? al-qadi `iyad is of the opinion that it is
~~better to recite them separately, but imam an-nawawi is of the view that
~~both ways are correct. in fact, in both ways the number remains the
~~same. besides, an addition must not be made to the sunnah of messenger
~~of allah (pbuh). practically we knew that it is necessary to use the
~~prescription of a physician without making any alteration in its
~~elements; otherwise, it will not work properly. similarly, there are
~~spiritual benefits, blessings and efficacy in the number told by the
~~prophet (pbuh). any alteration in it will nullify its blessing and
~~efficacy. (fath al-bari). this hadith reveals how fervently the
~~companions were inclined towards good and how concerned about surpassing
~~those who were better than them in some forms of good deeds. indeed, all
~~muslims are equal with regard to the practice of religious principles.
~~but what gives an edge to the rich over their poor coreligionists are
~~the financial forms of worship, that is, charity and almsgiving, which
~~the latter are unable to do. PageV01P0701

~~the middle of it he drew a line, the end of which jutted out beyond the
~~square. further across the middle line, he drew a number of smaller
~~lines. then he (pbuh) said, "the figure represents man and the
~~encircling square is the death which is encompassing him. the middle
~~line represents his desires and the smaller lines are vicissitudes of
~~life. if one of those misses him, another distresses him, and if that
~~one misses him, he falls victim to another.'' [al-bukhari]. commentary:
~~this means that human life is perpetually exposed to mishaps. if man
~~escapes one mishap, he comes across the other one. his life is spent in
~~a continuous struggle against tackling the hostile situations. besides,
~~his life remains entangled in unending hopes and wishes which are never
~~fulfilled and finally he slips into the iron-grip of death. to sum up,

~~remain unprepared for it. there is no end to wishful thinking and,

~~"hasten to do good deeds before you are overtaken by one of the seven

~~الترمذي وقال حديث حسن 580. ubayy bin ka`b (may allah be pleased with
~~him) reported: when one-third of the night would pass, messenger of
~~allah (pbuh) would get up and call out, "o people, remember allah. the
~~rajifah (i.e., the first blowing of the trumpet which will shake the
~~whole universe and thus cause all life to cease) has come, followed by
~~ar-radifah (i.e., the second blowing of the trumpet which will restore
~~life and thus mark the resurrection day). death has approached with all
~~that it comprises. death has approached with all that it comprises.'' i
~~said: "o messenger of allah (pbuh), i frequently invoke allah to elevate
~~your rank. how much of my supplications should i devote to you?'' he
~~said, "you may devote as much as you wish.'' when i suggested a quarter,
~~he said, "do whatever you wish, but it will be better for you if you
~~increase it.'' i suggested half, and he said, "do whatever you wish, but
~~it will be better for you if you increase.'' i suggested two-thirds, and
~~he said, "do whatever you wish but it will be better for you if you
~~increase it.'' i said, "shall i devote all my supplications invoking
~~allah to elevate your rank?'' he said, "then you will be freed from your
~~worries and your sins will be forgiven.'' [at-tirmidhi]. commentary: the
~~qur'an exactly corroborates what has been stated in this hadith. there
~~will be two soundings of the trumpet. the first will throw the earth and
~~mountains into tremendous convulsions, annihilating all life and
~~disrupting the entire physical structure of the universe. the second -
~~after an indefinite period of time known to allah alone - will mark the
~~resurrection day and bring forth the whole scenario of the last
~~judgement. messenger of allah (pbuh) has invited the attention of
~~mankind to the horrendous ordeal awaiting it in the last hour. besides,
~~this hadith urges the believers to send the maximum greetings to
~~messenger of allah (pbuh). it also highlights the excellence of such an
~~invocation. the qur'an itself makes this demand to the believers: "allah
~~sends his salat (graces, honours, blessings, mercy) on the prophet
~~(muhammad (pbuh)), and also his angels (ask allah to bless and forgive
~~him). o you who believe! send your salat on (ask allah to bless) him

~~recommendable from a theological point of view but, in the light of the
~~prophetic saying, it is also compulsory and binding. however, at the
~~dawn of islam it was forbidden due to the apprehension that the muslims
~~might relapse into some wrongdoing by harking back to the pre-islamic
~~memory. but when the monotheistic belief took root in their minds and
~~the apprehension of pagan echoings evaporated, the ban on visiting the
~~graves was lifted. rather an emphasis was laid on such a visit, so that

~~yourself, are all forms of moral behaviour that are counted as virtues
~~in islam. all that is bad and vicious is considered by islam as sinful.

~~which he replied: "i am not aware that you suckled me, and you did not
~~inform me.'' so he (`uqbah) rode to messenger of allah (pbuh) in al-
~~madinah and put the matter before him. the messenger of allah (pbuh)
~~said, "how can you continue (to be her husband) after what you have been
~~told?'' `uqbah (may allah be pleased with him) therefore divorced her
~~and she married another man. [al-bukhari]. commentary: opinions differ
~~about the evidence of a woman. but it is so about financial matters and
~~hudud (punishments) and qisas (retaliation in punishment). for example,
~~regarding the first, the qur'an says that the evidence of two women is
~~equal to that of one man. similarly, the `ulama' have not trusted the
~~evidence of a woman about matters concerning hudud and qisas, rather
~~they have considered in this connection, the evidence of man
~~indispensable. however, they are all unanimous in accepting the evidence
~~of even a single woman in matters of which men are uninformed. these,
~~for instance, include the problems of a child's birth and its legitimacy
~~and the weak points of women. and the argument is supported by this
~~hadith. when the woman gave evidence that she had suckled both the
~~husband and the wife and was the foster-mother of the two, they
~~separated from each other. also, messenger of allah (pbuh) declared
~~their wedlock untenable. the hadith urges us to dispense with what is

# وعن عياض بن حمار رضي الله عنه قال قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم :
~~[ إن الله أوحى إلي أن تواضعوا حتى لا يفخر أحد على أحد ولا يبغي أحد على
~~أحد ] رواه مسلم 602. `iyad bin himar (may allah be pleased with him)
~~reported: messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "allah has revealed to me that
~~you should humble yourselves to one another. one should neither hold
~~himself above another nor transgress against another.'' [muslim].
~~commentary: to treat each other humbly, leniently and lovingly is
~~understood as humility. one, under this principle, is also required not
~~to despise anybody on the basis of wealth, social distinction and
~~lineage. moreover, one should also not adopt an unkind attitude towards
~~others. besides, if allah has bestowed honour on somebody, he is
~~supposed to be grateful to him, instead of behaving disrespectfully
~~towards people and subjecting them to unkindness and tyranny.

# وعن أبي هريرة رضي الله عنه أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم قال : [
~~ما نقصت صدقة من مال وما زاد الله عبدا بعفو إلا عزا وما تواضع أحد لله إلا
~~رفعه ] رواه مسلم 603. abu hurairah (may allah be pleased with him)
~~reported: messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "wealth does not diminish by
~~giving sadaqah (charity). allah augments the honour of one who forgives;
~~and one who serves another seeking the pleasure of allah, allah will
~~exalt him in ranks.'' [muslim]. commentary: apparently giving in sadaqah
~~(charity) decreases wealth, but allah fairly compensates an almsgiver by
~~increasing his wealth. otherwise, he is sure to receive the best
~~recompense in the hereafter which will make good his loss. or, allah
~~blesses the rest of his wealth in such a way that the sense of loss is
~~removed from his mind. as for a lenient and humble attitude, it is
~~sometimes mistaken by man for his humiliation. but messenger of allah
~~(pbuh) calls such an impression as erroneous. indeed, humility increases
~~his honour and dignity. and as regards the hereafter, the best reward is
~~bound to accrue to him when he will be blessed with spiritual heights.

~~[al-bukhari and muslim]. commentary: to greet (saying as-salamu
~~`alaikum) small children is an excellent expression of humbleness.
~~similarly, a believer is under obligation to greet his wife and children

~~well. besides, he is also supposed to greet his subordinates, servants

~~on the sublime courtesy and unique humbleness of messenger of allah

~~too, we are informed about the extreme humbleness of messenger of allah
~~(pbuh). many a man deems his insult and indignity to extend his co-
~~operation to woman in household affairs. this is against the practice of
~~messenger of allah (pbuh). to co-operate with woman in doing domestic
~~things is a sunnah and man should not feel complex in it. however, an
~~excessive interest in domestic engagements which makes one indifferent
~~to salat is not desirable. rather, one is supposed to give up all

~~khutbah and turned to me. then a chair was brought for him and he sat on
~~it. he started instructing me what allah had taught him. then he resumed

~~his food, he would lick his three fingers (i.e., the forefinger, the
~~middle finger and the thumb). he (pbuh) said, "if anyone of you drops a
~~morsel, he should remove anything harmful from it and then eat it. he
~~should not leave it for shaitan.'' he commanded us to clean out the dish
~~saying, "you do not know in what portion of your food the blessing
~~lies.'' [muslim]. commentary: this hadith also stresses humbleness,
~~simplicity and regard for the blessings of allah. to be unwilling to
~~pick up a fallen morsel and eat it and to keep from cleaning up the dish
~~is the style of arrogant and wealthy people. it displays disregard for
~~allah's blessing. to eat the fallen morsel after cleaning it and to lick
~~up the dish shows, apart from humbleness, regard for the divine gift.
~~such an act pleases allah. in it there is another advantageous aspect.
~~man never knows which is the blessed portion of food. when one licks up
~~the dish, or even his fingers, picks up the fallen morsel and eats it
~~after cleaning it, nothing will be wasted from the meal. in this way,
~~the blessed portion of meal will automatically come to him and he will
~~not remain deprived of it. moreover, the hadith tells us that allah's
~~blessing, in whatever small quantity it may be, must not be wasted. yet
~~unfortunately, as we see today, food is wasted like anything in the
~~feasts and marriage ceremonies. whereas there are countless people in

~~annihilation and fall is the fate of everything. second, lest power and
~~growth should go to man's head, he is warned by being reduced to
~~smallness that there exists a supreme one who holds sway over all
~~creatures and can render the powerful weak and helpless. the bedouin
~~camel-rider resented the companions by overtaking messenger of allah

~~said: "a man likes to wear beautiful clothes and shoes?'' messenger of

~~commentary: the hadith says that a man who has even an iota of pride in

~~the smallest amount means in arabic either the smallest ant or the

~~if mere consideration of riches, physical beauty, social and
~~intellectual prominence and family status makes him proud and self-

~~them, and they will have a painful punishment. these are: an aged man
~~who commits zina (illicit sexual act), a ruler who lies, and a proud

~~will not say something which will please them, not to talk happily and
~~willingly. adultery is forbidden to everybody, whether young or old. but
~~it is more condemnable if an old man commits it, because to be guilty of
~~such a detestable act in old age shows that the adulterer has become
~~hardened in sin and his heart is free from the fear of allah. lying is

~~little reason to tell a lie. hence, if in spite of all this he invents a
~~lie, it will betray his vicious mind and lack of god-consciousness.
~~similarly, all humans are prohibited from giving vent to pride and
~~arrogance. but if a beggar or destitute, who has no reason to claim
~~dignity and superiority, displays arrogance, it will be a convincing
~~proof of his indifference to the fear of allah and shari`ah rules. from

~~said, "allah, the exalted, says: `honour is my izar and pride is my

~~superiority (honour), greatness and grandeur are divine attributes

~~of the game, killed on his suggestion or instruction, is forbidden to
~~him, too. for this reason, messenger of allah (pbuh) sent back the gift
~~of the wild ass to his companion. the hadith further illustrates that if

~~explain it so that the sender may not feel dejected. it may be mentioned
~~here that some ahadith allow us to eat the meat of a game killed by
~~others, whereas this hadith shows it is not permissible. the orthodox
~~`ulama', however, have attempted to reconcile the two seemingly
~~incompatible sets of ahadith with each other. according to the first
~~category of ahadith, a man, not in the state of ihram who kills a chase

~~virtue and sin, and he said, "virtue is noble behaviour, and sin is that
~~which creates doubt and you do not like people to know about it.''

~~also, a simple and understandable principle is laid down about sin. man
~~feels the pricking of conscience over every bad deed and is also afraid
~~of the reproach of fault-finders, provided he has not reached the lowest
~~point of moral depravity. but a seared conscience is least disturbed
~~even by a heinous and deadly sin or by public censure. we can understand
~~it by the example of man's smelling sense. if it is not dead, man can

~~allah (pbuh) was asked about the deed which will be foremost to lead a
~~man to jannah. he replied, "fear of allah and the good conduct.'' then
~~he was asked about indulgence which will admit a man to hell (fire) and
~~he answered, "the tongue and the genitals.'' [at-tirmidhi]. commentary:
~~this is also a very comprehensive hadith. fear of allah really links up
~~a man to him, and moral refinement prevents him from falling short of
~~his duties to people. to be sure, adherence to this two-fold practice
~~will cause the entry of a lot of people to jannah. many a man, on the
~~other hand, has a long, sharp and dangerous tongue and this causes him
~~to pour out heretic utterances and indulge in backbiting, slandering and
~~abusive and nonsensical talk. all this activity leads to hell. as for
~~genitals, an unwary and unrestrained attitude incites one to indulge in
~~immoral pursuits. in both these cases countless people will be led into
~~hell. for this reason it is imperative for everybody to develop taqwa
~~(consciousness of allah / fear of allah ) and refined behaviour and shun
~~the wickedness of tongue and genitals so that his life in the hereafter

~~hadith tells us that a man should avoid telling a lie even in a light
~~vein. if he gives great importance to the rules of the shari`ah (islamic

~~definitely refrain from telling a lie even in a chat session or just for

~~jocular mood, rather some will perhaps approve it. yet, allah
~~disapproves of even the harmless or trivial form of falsehood and
~~commands his slaves to keep away from it. from all considerations,
~~however, moral excellence carries immense weight. because no wrong or

~~reported: messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "verily allah has prescribed
~~ihsan (kindness) for everything. so when you kill, you must make the
~~killing in the best manner; when you slaughter, make your slaughter in
~~the best manner. let one of you sharpen his knife and give ease to his
~~animal (in order to reduce his pain).'' [muslim]. commentary: by killing
~~is meant the killing of a harmful animal, or the killing of a murderer
~~as retribution and the killing of the enemy in the battlefield. all
~~these situations warrant killing but with a stress on moderation, thanks
~~to islamic teachings. a believer is told not to let his passions of
~~enmity go wild, and even an enemy or a criminal ought not to be put to a
~~torturous death. in the pre-islamic period of ignorance it was a
~~prevalent practice that the limbs of a victim were mutilated before he
~~was finally killed. islam has forcefully forbidden this inhuman custom,
~~stating that the victim should be beheaded with the one swing of sword.
~~similarly, there are specific instructions regarding an animal's
~~slaughter. first, the knife should be sharpened. second, the animal must
~~not be slaughtered from its nape, because in both ways it will suffer
~~pain. this shari`ah rule ensures quick death of the animal. in modern
~~europe, an animal is slaughtered with one stroke of a cutting-machine.
~~apparently this method seems to be easy and smooth, yet in this way the
~~animal's blood doesn't flow out from its body completely. so the
~~consumption of the meat of such a kill is injurious to human health. due
~~to this reason, islam considers the discharge of blood as a prerequisite
~~to halal (lawful). certainly, only the islamic way of slaughtering an
~~animal is more sound, scientific and wholesome. PageV01P0787

~~pleased with her) reported: whenever the prophet (pbuh) was given a
~~choice between two matters, he would (always) choose the easier as long
~~as it was not sinful to do so; but if it was sinful he was most strict
~~in avoiding it. he never took revenge upon anybody for his own sake; but
~~when allah's legal bindings were outraged, he would take revenge for
~~allah's sake. [al-bukhari and muslim]. commentary: the two things
~~between which messenger of allah (pbuh) would make his choice could be
~~religious or worldly. for instance, if he were asked to award one of the
~~two punishments to somebody, he would choose the milder one. and if he
~~had the liberty of choice between two obligations, he would opt for the
~~easier one. between war and peace he would always go for peace, provided
~~it involved the interest of islam and muslims. moreover, in all matters
~~he used to take the line of least resistance, in case it went without
~~the disobedience of allah. in this hadith, a principle has been defined
~~for muslims in general as well that they are free to take to an easy way
~~but this must not entail a loophole in respect of the shari`ah.
~~secondly, the most excellent character of messenger of allah (pbuh) also
~~comes to our view that he never retaliated for personal reasons. his
~~extraordinary concern for the sanctity of islamic law is also displayed
~~by the fact that he could never brook the transgression of allah's
~~limits, and the transgressor was sure to be punished by him. the
~~prophet's attitude also explains and delimits the sphere of morality
~~that to let the violator of divine law go scot-free must not be counted
~~as a sign of good manners. rather it reflects the lack of religious
~~sensibility. not to take exception to lapses in mundane affairs surely
~~speaks of moral excellence, but we are not allowed to dispense with the
~~evasion of religious rules. PageV01P0788

~~could be that the incident occurred somewhere at mina where, during the
~~hajj season, he urged the different clans to accept the message of islam
~~so as to seek their help to establish the true religion. qarn ath-
~~tha`alib is also the name of a place which is the miqat (transit-point
~~where pilgrims assume the state of ihram) of the najd people. this
~~hadith also reflects the marvellous character of messenger of allah
~~(pbuh) that he never rebuked the ignorant and those who caused him harm,
~~nor did he ever avenge anybody on grounds of personal hostility.
~~secondly, he would endure all forms of hardships in the way of allah
~~with patience and endurance. he never became furious over his harassers,
~~rather he prayed for their guidance. no doubt, the prophetic life-
~~pattern perennially provides inspiration to preachers and religious
~~instructors. the responsibility of preaching is not a bed of roses but a
~~thorny path to tread on. it is not the welcome and applause which is
~~meted out to him, but people's taunts, reproaches and insults are heaped
~~on the preacher. consequently, patience, self-possession, self-control
~~and tolerance are vital to braving trials and tribulations in the way of

~~addressed the people saying, "the people before you were ruined because

~~but if a weak person amongst them committed theft, they would execute
~~the legal punishment on him. by allah, were fatimah, the daughter of
~~muhammad, to commit the theft, i would have cut off her hand.'' [al-

~~clearly tells us that no intercession is allowed for a person who
~~transgresses the limits set by allah. and if anybody has the audacity to
~~do so, the deciding authority is presumed to be impervious to his
~~solicitation. nor should the criminal's social status or family
~~influence, if any, obstruct the administration of justice. the law and

~~the prophets means that rulership and government affairs were also
~~assigned to them, that is, both religious and worldly affairs lay in
~~their custody. there was no dichotomy between the two, they formed a
~~single unit. this also characterized the period of the rightly-guided
~~caliphs and the short spell that followed it in the history of islam.

~~primarily fulfill their allegiance pledged to the first caliph and keep

~~supplicate allah in their favour. the worst of your rulers are those
~~whom you hate and who hate you; and whom you curse and who curse you.''
~~it was asked (by those who were present): "should not we oppose them?''

~~categories of rulers. first, those rulers who are well-wishers of people
~~and provide them with justice. these are the best rulers for whom people
~~also pray. second, the worst rulers who are only concerned with their
~~rule and interests and take no interest in providing justice to people

~~to take a rest. some of us began to set right their tents, others began
~~to graze their animals while others were engaged in competing with one
~~another in archery when an announcer of messenger of allah (pbuh)
~~announced that people should gather for salat. we gathered around the
~~messenger of allah and he ((pbuh)) addressed us, saying, "every prophet
~~before me was under obligation to guide his followers to what he knew
~~was good for them and to warn the evil thing which he knew. as for this
~~ummah, it will have sound state and in its early stage of existence; but
~~the last phase of its existence, will be faced with trials and with
~~things you do not recognize. there will be tremendous trials, one after
~~the other, and to each the believer will say, `that is it'. whenever a
~~trial arrives the believer will say: `this is going to bring about my
~~destruction.' when this passes, another calamity will approach and he
~~will say: `this surely is going to be my end.' whosoever wishes to be
~~removed from the fire (hell) and admitted to jannah should die with
~~faith in allah and the last day; and he should treat others as he wishes
~~to be treated. he who swears allegiance to an imam, he should give him
~~the pledge in ratification and the sincerity of his heart. he should
~~obey him to the best of his capacity. if another man comes forward as a
~~claimant (when one has already been installed), behead the second.''
~~[muslim]. commentary: here `its early stage' means the period of the
~~companions, of the successors (of the companions), and of the followers
~~(of the successors). in another hadith, it has been called as the best
~~era. in comparison with all the succeeding periods, this period is
~~surpassingly good, peaceful and blessed. later would emerge, it was
~~prophesized, mischief after mischief, each being worse than the
~~preceding one. today, everybody sees the truth of this prophecy like the
~~light of day. by predicting the emergence of mischief, messenger of
~~allah (pbuh) wanted to warn his followers that they should keep
~~themselves aloof from them. to them he further explained in advance the
~~precautionary measures, that is, to keep faith in allah, to remain firm-
~~footed in the belief in the hereafter and to deal with people fairly,
~~attempting to be polite to them at the same time. besides, prophecy has
~~been made about the abundance of the power-hungry people with a remedial
~~note. in the first instance believers are supposed to swear allegiance
~~to the caliph, and by extending their cooperation to him they should
~~kill another claimant to the caliphate because it is only in this way
~~that the unity of the muslim ummah can be maintained, free of chaos and
~~discord. yet, unfortunately, the power-orientated groups have found a
~~plaything in the shape of democracy, turning peace and unity into a
~~legend of the past. what a pity that despite all that they seek
~~stability and progress! is it the miracle of time or the quirk of the
~~vested interests that has reversed the whole scheme of things? there is

~~turned away from him, but he repeated the same question. thereupon
~~messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "listen to them and obey them. they are

~~[muslim]. commentary: this hadith means that both the ruler and the
~~ruled have their own respective obligations. if any of the two sides
~~fails to play its due role, it will bear the brunt of its deficiency on

~~one's own hands, yet there always remains room for improvement and
~~positive criticism. to make use of it within limits and to make efforts
~~for the enforcement of the canonical discipline will not be deemed as an
~~uprising. indeed, this will be deemed, to some extent, binding on

~~you will be left alone as its captive. if you take an oath to do

~~by rulership is meant caliphate or any other rank affiliated to its

~~extraordinary position as it entails a heavy responsibility and one may
~~face a sufficient difficulty in being absolved from it. however, if a
~~man gets it without solicitation, he should accept it. the other part of
~~the hadith concerns swearing. somebody takes an oath to do something but
~~he finds another work more rewarding and righteous. in such a situation
~~he is advised to dissolve his oath and make expiation for it.
~~thereafter, he will be free to avail the advantageous option. as for the
~~expiation of breaking an oath, there are four options: to set free a

~~there are, according to this hadith, two conditions for putting people
~~in official positions. the first is the relevant talent for the job, a
~~man is put in charge of; and the second is his capacity for discharging
~~responsibilities thereof. for example, a ruler should primarily possess
~~the ability to maintain law and order and to establish justice; and

~~two of my cousins. one of them said to him: "o messenger of allah
~~(pbuh), appoint me governor of some land over which allah has given you

# عن ابن عمر رضي الله عنهما أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم مر على رجل
~~من الأنصار وهو يعظ أخاه في الحياء . فقال رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم :
~~[ دعه فإن الحياء من الإيمان ] متفق عليه 681. ibn `umar (may allah be
~~pleased with them) reported: messenger of allah (pbuh) passed by a man
~~of the ansar who was admonishing his brother regarding shyness.
~~messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "leave him alone, for modesty is a part
~~of iman.'' [al-bukhari and muslim]. commentary: the ansari, who was
~~being lectured by his brother, was indeed an embodiment of modesty and
~~unpretentiousness. such a man is never sharp in worldly affairs because
~~modesty restrains him from following wrong ways. for this reason,
~~modesty has been called a part of the faith. this is an inborn quality,
~~that is, some people are unassertive by birth. yet, if they are
~~gradually guided and directed towards virtues, their unassumingness
~~further increases. and in islam it is counted a virtue. PageV01P0847

~~does not bring anything except good.'' [al-bukhari and muslim]. in a
~~narration of muslim: messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "all of shyness is
~~good.'' commentary: this hadith enlightens us on the excellence of
~~modesty, which serves the good purpose of preventing man from the
~~disobedience of allah and from immoral and evil pursuits. evidently, it
~~has a salutary impact on society. besides, it keeps man free from sins,
~~and, consequently, he will stand blameless with allah. from this
~~standpoint, modesty is certainly a thorough good. PageV01P0848

~~: القطعة والخصلة و [ الإماطة ] : الإزالة و [ الأذى ] : ما يؤذي كحجر وشوك
~~وطين ورماد وقذر ونحو ذلك 683. abu hurairah (may allah be pleased with

~~seventy odd branches. the uppermost of all these is the testimony of
~~faith: `la ilaha illallah' (there is no true god except allah) while the
~~least of them is the removal of harmful object from the road. and
~~shyness is a branch of iman.'' [al-bukhari and muslim]. commentary: this
~~hadith has already occurred in a previous chapter, see commentary on
~~hadith no. 125. here it has been repeated with reference to the degrees
~~of faith. modesty, too, is a part of faith, rather one of its most
~~important ingredients, because it plays an effective role in the
~~training and sublimation of human psyche. PageV01P0849

~~messenger of allah (pbuh) was even shier than a virgin behind her veil.
~~when he saw something which he disliked, we could perceive it on his
~~face. [al-bukhari and muslim]. commentary: though this hadith
~~particularly refers to the character of messenger of allah (pbuh), it
~~also reveals the fact that modesty is a peculiar quality of woman. an
~~unmarried woman, above all else, is considered to be the embodiment of
~~bashfulness. islamic countries have witnessed many curses of western

~~commentary: islam treats conjugal union as a sacred and secret act, both
~~in social and moral terms. indeed, the sanctity of conjugal rights
~~contributes to the consolidation of moral norms and social cohesion.
~~yet, what passes between wife and husband on the consummation night is
~~usually taken in a light vein in our societies. in the morning, both of
~~them relate their sexual experience to their friends respectively. this

~~with him) and offered hafsah for marriage to him. `uthman said: "i shall
~~think over the matter.'' i waited for a few days and then `uthman met me
~~and said: "it occurred to me that i should not marry at present.'' then
~~i met abu bakr (may allah be pleased with him) and said to him: "if you
~~are willing, i shall marry my daughter hafsah to you.'' abu bakr (may
~~allah be pleased with him) remained silent and did not utter any word to
~~me in reply. i grew more angry with him than with `uthman. i had waited
~~for only a few days when messenger of allah (pbuh) asked for her hand in
~~marriage and i married her to him. thereafter, i met abu bakr (may allah
~~be pleased with him) who said, "perhaps you were angry with me when you

~~is so.'' he said, "nothing stopped me to respond to your offer except

~~not disclose the secret of messenger of allah (pbuh). had messenger of
~~allah (pbuh) left her, i would have accepted her.'' [al-bukhari and
~~muslim]. commentary: to keep a secret and not to disclose it to people
~~is the theme of this chapter as reflected in this hadith. the hadith has
~~also other points which invite our attention. firstly, a man can offer
~~his daughter's hand to a righteous person. secondly, it is undesirable
~~for parents to send a message to another party for the wedlock of their
~~daughter when talks with someone else are already continuing in this
~~regard. thirdly, if messenger of allah (pbuh) wanted to marry a woman
~~but could not realize his intention for a reason or another, it was
~~permissible for a muslim to marry her because, juristically speaking,
~~such a woman could not be counted as the prophet's wife. PageV01P0854

~~(may allah be pleased with her) who walked after the style of his
~~father, came there. he (pbuh) welcomed her saying, "welcome, o my
~~daughter'', and made her sit on his right side, or on his left side and
~~then whispered something to her at which she wept bitterly. when he
~~perceived her grief, he talked secretly to her again and she smiled
~~(with happiness). i said to her: "messenger of allah (pbuh chose you
~~from amongst all his wives to speak secretly to you and yet you cried.''
~~when he left, i asked her, "what did messenger of allah (pbuh) say to
~~you?'' she said, "i will not divulge the secret of messenger of allah
~~(pbuh).'' when messenger of allah (pbuh) passed away, i said to her: "i
~~adjure you by the right i have in respect of you to tell me what
~~messenger of allah (pbuh) had told you.'' she said: "now (when messenger
~~of allah (pbuh) has died), i will tell you. when he whispered to me the
~~first time, he told me, `jibril (gabriel) used to listen to my
~~recitation of the qur'an and then recite it back to me once or twice a
~~year, and this time he has done it twice; and so i perceive that my
~~death is approaching. then be mindful of your duty to allah and be
~~patient and steadfast, for i shall be an excellent predecessor for you.'
~~on this i wept as you saw. when he perceived my distress he talked to me
~~secretly the second time and said, `o fatimah, are you not pleased that
~~you will be the chief among the believing women or of this ummah?' this
~~made me smile as you saw.'' [al-bukhari and muslim]. commentary: this
~~hadith, too, has an implication for keeping a secret and concealing it
~~from people. moreover, we learn that one can spontaneously weep over
~~hearing a sorrowful occurrence and also that we should be patient in
~~distress. the hadith also teaches us not to feel proud upon receiving a
~~blessing. above all, the excellence of fatimah (may allah be pleased
~~with her) and the advisability of reading the qur'an are brought into
~~our focus. PageV01P0855

~~"prolonging salat (prayer) and shortening the khutbah (religious talk)
~~indicate the religious knowledge of the person. make your salat long and

~~no means implies a disregard of worshipper's constraints. it is indeed
~~forbidden. rather the imam is emphatically told to perform a brief and
~~concise salat because his followers also include, amongst others, the
~~weak, the aged and the sick people. herein an emphasis is laid on
~~prolonging salat instead of khutbah (religious talk). the friday khutbah
~~is meant to be brief. it must not be too lengthy in relation to a brief
~~salat offered heedlessly and in sheer haste. salat must be offered in
~~all humility and with full attention and concentration of mind.
~~furthermore, a worshippper ought to maintain a well-paused equilibrium

~~have never before seen an instructor who gave better instruction than
~~he, may my father and mother be sacrificed for him. he neither
~~remonstrated me, nor beat me, nor abused me. he simply said,"it is not
~~permissible to talk during salat because it consists of glorifying
~~allah, declaring his greatness as well as recitation of the qur'an,'' or
~~he said words to that effect.'' i said: "o allah's messenger, i have but
~~recently accepted islam, and allah has favoured us with islam. there are

~~not consult them.'' then i said: "there are some of us who are guided by
~~omens.'' he said, "these things which come to their minds. they should
~~not be influenced by them.'' (muslim). commentary: this hadith
~~emphasizes four points. firstly, as no talk is allowed in salat
~~(prayer), nobody can utter benedictory words for a sneezer either.
~~secondly, this hadith throws light on the prophet's way of imparting
~~moral instruction to others. he would prudently enlighten ignorant
~~people on islam, avoiding to express his resentment over their lapses
~~which simply betrayed their lack of knowledge. this has a lesson for
~~`ulama' and preachers. thirdly, muslims are prohibited from consulting
~~soothsayers. fourthly, belief in bad omens is also prohibited.
~~divinations and presages were the popular fallacies of arabs in the pre-

# 709. abu musa al-ash`ari (may allah be pleased with him) reported: one
~~day, i performed my wudu' in my house and then set forth with the
~~determination that i would stick to messenger of allah (pbuh) and spend
~~the whole day with him. i came to the mosque and asked about him. the
~~companions told that he (pbuh) had gone in a certain direction. abu musa
~~added: i followed him inquiring until i came to bi'r aris (a well in the
~~suburb of al-madinah). (there) i sat down at the door till he (pbuh) had
~~relieved himself and performed wudu'. then i went to him and saw him
~~sitting on the platform of the well with his shanks uncovered and his
~~legs dangling in the well. i greeted him and returned to the door of the
~~garden, saying to myself, "i will be the doorkeeper of the messenger of
~~allah today.'' abu bakr (may allah be pleased with him) came and knocked
~~at the door. i said; "who is that?'' he said: "abu bakr.'' i said, "wait
~~a moment.'' then i went to the messenger of allah (pbuh) and said, "o
~~messenger of allah! abu bakr is at the door seeking permission to
~~enter.'' he said, "admit him and give him the glad tidings of jannah.''
~~i returned and said to abu bakr (may allah be pleased with him): "you
~~may enter and messenger of allah (pbuh) has given you the glad tidings
~~of (entering) jannah.'' abu bakr (may allah be pleased with him) came in
~~and sat down on the right side of messenger of allah (pbuh) and
~~suspended his legs into the well and uncovered his shanks, as the
~~messenger of allah had done. i returned to the door and sat down. i had
~~left my brother at home while he was performing wudu' and intending to
~~join me. i said to myself: "if allah intends good for him (i.e., to be
~~blessed to come at this time and receive the glad tidings of entering
~~jannah), he will bring him here.'' someone knocked at the door and i
~~said, "who is it?'' he said, "umar bin al-khattab.'' i said, "wait a
~~moment.'' then i proceeded towards messenger of allah (pbuh). i greeted
~~him and said, "umar is at the door, seeking permission to enter. he
~~said, "let him in and give him the glad tidings of entering jannah.'' i
~~went back to `umar (may allah be pleased with him) and said to him,
~~"messenger of allah has given you permission as well as glad tidings of
~~entering jannah.'' he entered and sat down with messenger of allah
~~(pbuh) on his left side and dangled his feet into the well. i returned
~~to the door and sat down and said to myself: "if allah intends good for
~~my brother, he will bring him here.'' someone knocked at the door and i
~~said, "who is it?'' he said, "uthman bin `affan.'' i said, "wait a
~~moment.'' i went to messenger of allah (pbuh) and informed him about his
~~arrival. he said, "let him in and give him glad tidings of entering
~~jannah together with a tribulation which he will have to face.'' i came
~~back to him and said, "you may enter; and messenger of allah (pbuh)
~~gives you the glad tidings of entering jannah together with a
~~tribulation that will afflict you.'' he got in and saw that the elevated
~~platform round the well was fully occupied. so he sat on opposite side.
~~sa`id bin al-musaiyab (may allah be pleased with him) a subnarrator has
~~reported: the order in which they sat down indicated the places of their
~~burial. [al-bukhari and muslim]. another narration adds: abu musa al-
~~ash`ari (may allah be pleased with him) said: the prophet (pbuh) ordered
~~me to guard the door. when `uthman was told (about the misfortune) he
~~praised allah then said: "allahu musta`an (his help is to be sought).''
~~(the interpretation of sa`id bin al-musaiyab is that the graves of abu
~~bakr and `umar (may allah be pleased with them) are by the side of the
~~prophet (pbuh), in the same position they took when they sat next to the
~~prophet (pbuh) while the grave of `uthman is away from their graves, in
~~the public graveyard of al-madinah known as baqi` al-gharqad).
~~commentary: this hadith brings four points under our consideration.
~~first, in certain cases, a glad tiding is given about the future life.
~~second, the prophet (pbuh) himself gave the good news to the first three
~~rightly-guided khulafa' (caliphs) that they would go to jannah. now only
~~an inborn wretch can doubt their faith. third, the riot foretold by the
~~prophet (pbuh) with regard to `uthman (may allah be pleased with him)
~~took place in the concluding days of his caliphate. influenced by the
~~wicked and baseless propaganda of a jew, `abdullah bin saba', a splinter
~~group blockaded `uthman's house and finally put him to death. the
~~incident reveals the prophet's truthfulness. fourth, things are also
~~interpreted while one is awake, and the power of intuition is of course
~~the basis of such a state. yet, a vision is not necessarily commensurate
~~with the external reality in all cases. however, the first two caliphs,
~~as envisioned by abu musa al-ash`ari (may allah be pleased with him),
~~are eternally resting, along with the prophet (pbuh), in `aishah's room,
~~while `uthman (may allah be pleased with him) is buried in the al-
~~madinan graveyard of baqi` al-gharqad. PageV01P0895

~~فقمنا فكنت أول من فزع فخرجت أبتغي رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم حتى أتيت
~~حائطا للأنصار لبني النجار فدرت به هل أجد له بابا فلم أجد فإذا ربيع يدخل
~~في جوف حائط من بئر خارجة ( والربيع : الجدول الصغير ) فاحتفزت فدخلت على
~~رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم . فقال : [ أبو هريرة ؟ ] فقلت : نعم يا
~~رسول الله . قال : [ ما شأنك ؟ ] قلت : كنت بين ظهرينا فقمت فأبطأت علينا
~~فخشينا أن تقتطع دوننا ففزعنا فكنت أول من فزع فأتيت هذا الحائط فاحتفزت

~~وتصاغرت حتى أمكنني الدخول 710. abu hurairah (may allah be pleased with
~~him) reported: we were sitting in the company of the messenger of allah
~~(pbuh), and abu bakr and `umar (may allah be pleased with them) were
~~also present. all of a sudden the messenger of allah (pbuh) got up and
~~left us. when he was late to return to us we began to worry lest he
~~should meet with trouble in our absence. i was the first to be alarmed
~~and set out in search of him until i came to a garden belonging to banu-
~~najjar (a section of the ansar). i went round it looking for an
~~entrance, but failed to find one. however, i saw a stream of water
~~flowing into the garden from a well outside. i drew myself together like
~~a fox and slinked into the place and reached the messenger of allah
~~(pbuh). he said, "is it abu hurairah?'' i replied in the affirmative. he
~~asked, "what is the matter with you?'' i replied, "you were sitting with
~~us and then you left us and delayed for a time. fearing you had met with
~~some adversities we got alarmed. i was the first to be alarmed. so when
~~i came to this garden, i squeezed myself like a fox and these people are
~~coming behind me.'' he (the prophet (pbuh)) gave me his sandals and
~~said, "o abu hurairah! take these sandals of mine, and whoever you meet
~~outside this garden testifying that la ilaha illallah (there is no true
~~god except allah), being assured of it in his heart, give him the glad
~~tidings that he will enter jannah.'' (abu hurairah then narrated the
~~hadith in full). [muslim]. commentary: as explained earlier in detail, a
~~believer will definitely go to jannah, provided he/she sincerely
~~believes in allah without associating anyone with his divinity, either
~~he/she is very likely to be admitted to jannah in the first stage, or

~~قليلا والله سبحانه أعلم 711. ibn shumasah reported: we visited `amr bin
~~al-`as (may allah be pleased with him) when he was in his deathbed. he
~~wept for a long time and turned his face towards the wall. his son said:
~~"o father, did not the messenger of allah (pbuh) give you the good news
~~of such and such? did he not give you glad tidings of such and such?''
~~then he (`amr) turned his face towards us and said: "the best thing
~~which you can count upon is the affirmation that: la ilaha illallah
~~(there is no true god except allah), and that muhammad is the messenger
~~of allah. i have passed through three phases. i remember when i hated
~~none more than i hated the messenger of allah (pbuh), and there was no
~~other desire stronger in me than that of killing him. had i died in that
~~state, i would have definitely been one of the dwellers of fire (hell).
~~when allah instilled the love for islam in my heart, i went to messenger
~~of allah (pbuh) and said, `extend your right hand, so that i pledge
~~allegiance to you.' he (pbuh) stretched out his right hand, but i
~~withdrew my hand. he said, `what is the matter, `amr?' i said, `i wish
~~to lay down same conditions.' he asked, `what conditions do you wish to
~~put forward?' i replied, `to be granted forgiveness.' he said, `do you
~~not know that (embracing) islam wipes out all that has gone before it
~~(previous misdeeds). verily, emigration wipes out all the previous sins,
~~and the hajj (pilgrimage) wipes out all the previous sins.' thereafter,
~~no one was dearer to me than messenger of allah (pbuh), and none was
~~more respectable than him in my eyes. so bright was his splendour that i
~~could not gather enough courage to look at his face for any length of
~~time. if i were asked to describe his feature, i would not be able to do
~~so because i have never caught a full glimpse of his face. had i died in
~~that state i could have hoped to be one of the dwellers of jannah.
~~thereafter, we were made responsible for many things and in the light of
~~which i am unable to know what is in store for me. when i die, no
~~mourner, nor fire should accompany my bier. when you bury me, throw the
~~earth gently over me and stand over my grave for the space of time
~~within which a camel is slaughtered and its meat is distributed so that
~~i may enjoy your intimacy, and in your presence ascertain what answer
~~can i give to the messengers of my rubb (the angels in grave).''
~~[muslim]. commentary: this hadith tells us about three phases of the
~~life of `amr bin al-`as (may allah be pleased with him), that is, pre-
~~islamic period, post-faith period and the governorship period. of the
~~last one, when he shouldered heavy responsibilities, he feared that he
~~might have committed some lapses and for that he might be subjected to
~~accountability before allah. the hadith invites our attention to the
~~following points: first, amr's vehement hostility of pre-faith days was
~~transformed into intense love for the prophet (pbuh) upon embracing
~~islam. second, the greatness of the prophet (pbuh) was ingrained in the
~~companions' hearts. third, the fear of error and the hope of divine
~~mercy may cause one to shed tears at the moment of death. fourth, it is
~~desirable on the part of relatives and friends to do something for the
~~comfort of a dying person by giving him the glad tidings of allah's
~~mercy. fifth, islam wipes out all previous sins, but afterwards, life
~~should be led according to the dictates of true faith. in the same way
~~the minor sins are pardoned on account of hijrah, and hajj, but a
~~sincere repentance with all its conditions is indispensable to the
~~remission of major sins. sixth, lamentation over a dead body is
~~forbidden. seventh, one may desirably make a will before death,
~~particularly with regard to the anti-shari`ah heresies and rites to
~~which the bereaved people are likely to take recourse. eighth, there is
~~an affirmation of the orthodox belief that munkir and nakir (two angels)
~~appear in the grave and question the dead person about his or her
~~religious beliefs. ninth, to stand over the grave and to pray for the
~~salvation of the dead person is a desirable act, as the dead person
~~enjoys the intimacy and the visit of the righteous to his grave. this
~~hadith, therefore, recommends believers to pray for the firmness of the
~~dead person. PageV01P0897

~~رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم ( انظر الحديث رقم 345 ) - قال : قام رسول
~~الله صلى الله عليه و سلم فينا خطيبا فحمد الله وأثنى عليه ووعظ وذكر ثم
~~قال : [ أما بعد ألا أيها الناس فإنما أنا بشر يوشك أن يأتي رسول ربي فأجيب
~~وأنا تارك فيكم ثقلين : أولهما كتاب الله فيه الهدى والنور فخذوا بكتاب

~~أذكركم الله في أهل بيتي ] رواه مسلم . وقد سبق بطوله 712. yazid bin
~~haiyan (may allah be pleased with him) reported: i went along with
~~husain bin sabrah and `amr bin muslim to zaid bin arqam (may allah be
~~pleased with them) and, as we sat by his side, husain said to him: "o
~~zaid, you acquired great merits that you saw messenger of allah (pbuh),
~~listened to his talk, fought by his side in (different) battles, and
~~offered salat behind him. you have in fact earned great merits, zaid!
~~could you then tell us what you heard from the messenger of allah
~~(pbuh)?'' he said: "o my cousin! by allah! i have grown old and have
~~almost spent up my age and i have forgotten some of the things which i
~~remembered in connection with messenger of allah (pbuh), so accept what
~~i narrate to you, and what i fail to narrate, do not compel me to
~~narrate that.'' he then said: "one day messenger of allah (pbuh) stood
~~up to deliver a khutbah at a watering place known as khumm between
~~makkah and al-madinah. he praised allah, extolled him and delivered the
~~khutbah and exhorted (us) and said, `amma ba`du (now then)! o people,
~~certainly i am a human being. i am about to receive a messenger (the
~~angel of death) from my rubb and i, in response to allah's call, but i
~~am leaving among you two weighty things: the book of allah in which
~~there is right guidance and light, so hold fast to the book of allah and

~~then said, `the second are the members of my household, i remind you (of
~~your duties) to the members of my family.''' commentary: the prophet
~~(pbuh) told his companions with reference to his human nature that he
~~too could not escape death because it was a grim reality. so he left his
~~example to others with regard to making a will before death. the hadith

~~حاجته ( 1 ) ] رواه البخاري 718. jabir (may allah be pleased with him)
~~reported: messenger of allah (pbuh) used to teach us the istikharah
~~(seeking guidance from allah) in all matters as he would teach us a
~~surah of the qur'an. he used to say: "when one of you contemplates
~~entering upon an enterprise, let him perform two rak`ah of optional
~~prayer other than fard prayers and then supplicate: "allahumma inni
~~astakhiruka bi `ilmika, wa astaqdiruka bi qudratika, wa as-'aluka min
~~fadlikal-`azim. fainnaka taqdiru wa la aqdiru, wa ta`lamu wa la a`lamu,
~~wa anta `allamul-ghuyub. allahumma in kunta ta`lamu anna hadhal-`amra
~~(and name what you want to do) khairun li fi dini wa ma`ashi wa `aqibati
~~amri, (or he said) `ajili amri ajilihi, faqdurhu li wa yassirhu li,
~~thumma barik li fihi. wa in kunta ta`lamu anna hadhal `amra (and name
~~what you want to do) sharrun li fi dini wa ma`ashi wa `aqibati amri, (or
~~he said) wa `ajili amri wa ajilihi, fasrifhu `anni, wasrifni `anhu,
~~waqdur liyal-khaira haithu kana, thumma ardini bihi.'' (o allah, i
~~consult you through your knowledge, and i seek strength through your
~~power, and ask of your great bounty; for you are capable whereas i am
~~not and, you know and i do not, and you are the knower of hidden things.
~~o allah, if you know that this matter (and name it) is good for me in
~~respect of my deen, my livelihood and the consequences of my affairs,
~~(or he said), the sooner or the later of my affairs then ordain it for
~~me, make it easy for me, and bless it for me. but if you know this
~~matter (and name it) to be bad for my deen, my livelihood or the
~~consequences of my affairs, (or he said) the sooner or the later of my
~~affairs then turn it away from me, and turn me away from it, and grant
~~me power to do good whatever it may be, and cause me to be contented
~~with it). and let the supplicant specify the object.'' [al-bukhari and
~~muslim] commentary: literally istikharah means seeking goodness from
~~allah through a particular prayer. this hadith lays emphasis on it and
~~displays its significance. we should, therefore, practise istikharah
~~regarding every important matter. however, it is imperative only in
~~cases where one is ignorant of good and evil. yet, with regard to
~~obligatory and indisputable rules, practices of the prophet (pbuh) and
~~commendable deeds, no istikharah is allowed. similarly, commands and
~~prohibitions of the shari`ah are categorical and nobody is allowed to
~~seek further guidance by performing istikharah prayer. moreover, to set
~~aside the example of the prophet (pbuh) of istikharah, and to trust
~~astrologers, palmists and soothsayers seeking the knowledge of future
~~events is sheer ignorance and unpardonable error. the knowledge of the
~~unseen (or ghaib) is the domain of allah alone and man is supposed to
~~seek his blessings. only allah is omnipotent and humans must turn to him
~~to seek inspiration and strength, trusting everything to his care.
~~istikharah prayer can be offered at any time except in the forbidden
~~hours for prayer because the performance of two rak`ah is a prerequisite
~~to it. some people think that the right time for it is before going to
~~bed. this is not true. this supplication (du`a) can be offered even
~~after performing the two rak`ah of istikharah prayer, or before taslim
~~(i.e., saying assalamu `alaikum to conclude the prayer) after tashahhud
~~or in the state of prostration. if somebody does not know this du`a by
~~heart, he can, after performing the prayer, read it from some
~~prayerbook. _________ [ ( 1 ) أي بدل قوله " هذا الأمر " فيقول مثلا : "

~~went to his lodge in mina and sacrificed. then he called for a barber
~~and pointed his right side to him, said, "shave from here.'' then he
~~pointed his left side and said, "take (hair) from here.'' then he
~~distributed his hair among the people. [al-bukhari and muslim]. another
~~narration is: after the messenger of allah (pbuh) had thrown pebbles at
~~jamrah and sacrificed an animal, he turned the right side of his head
~~towards the barber who shaved it for him. then he called abu talhah
~~ansari (may allah be pleased with him) and gave his hair to him. then he
~~turned his head to the left side and asked the barber to shave it. he
~~gave the hair to abu talhah and told him, "distribute it among the
~~people.'' commentary: after returning from `arafat on the 10th of dhul-
~~hijjah, pilgrims throw pebbles at jamrat-ul-aqabah. this is followed by
~~the sacrifice of an animal, the shaving of the head and the farewell
~~tawaf (circumambulation) of the holy house. all this is to be observed
~~on the sacrificial day in the exact order of priorities. yet, an
~~unexpected disturbance in this order involves no juristic disadvantage.
~~moreover, the act of throwing pebbles marks an end to the ban on legal
~~concessions. but this permissibility is minor and partial, that is,
~~everything becomes lawful except the physical contact with one's wife.
~~the ban is totally lifted in the wake of the farewell circumambulation
~~of the house of allah. secondly, we are told that the ritual shaving of

~~قال الشيطان أدركتم المبيت وإذا لم يذكر الله تعالى عند طعامه قال أدركتم

~~reported: i heard messenger of allah (pbuh) saying, "if a person
~~mentions the name of allah upon entering his house or eating, satan
~~says, addressing his followers: `you will find no where to spend the
~~night and no dinner.' but if he enters without mentioning the name of
~~allah, satan says (to his followers); `you have found (a place) to spend
~~the night in, and if he does not mention the name of allah at the time
~~of eating, satan says: `you have found (a place) to spend the night in
~~as well as food.''' [muslim]. commentary: herein, we are told that in
~~order to ward off satan and his followers, we are supposed to remember
~~allah before entering our house and before beginning to eat. the
~~remembrance of allah implies those appropriate prayers of the prophet
~~(pbuh) which have been mentioned in ahadith. for example, we are

~~(may allah be pleased with him) reported: when we attended a meal with
~~the messenger of allah (pbuh), we would not stretch forth our hands
~~towards the food until he (pbuh) would start eating first. once, we were
~~with him when a little girl rushed in as if someone was impelling her.
~~she was about to lay her hand on the food when the messenger of allah
~~(pbuh) caught her hand. then a bedouin came in rushing as if someone
~~were pushing him. he (pbuh) caught his hand also and said, "satan
~~considers that food lawful for himself on which the name of allah is not
~~mentioned. he (satan) brought this girl to make the food lawful through
~~her but i caught her hand. then he brought the bedouin to make it lawful
~~through him but i caught his hand too. by him in whose hand my soul is,
~~now satan's hand is in my grasp along with their hands.'' then he
~~mentioned the name of allah and began to eat. [abu dawud and an-nasa'i].
~~commentary: here, too, we are told that if we do not pronounce allah's
~~name, satan and his minions will share our meal with us. so prior to
~~eating, we must pronounce the name of allah. an incident is related in
~~this hadith. once, messenger of allah (pbuh) and his companions were
~~just to start taking their meal when an unknown girl and a bedouin burst
~~upon the scene. without seeking the formal permission and pronouncing
~~the name of allah they hurriedly stretched their hands to eat. yet,
~~messenger of allah (pbuh) restrained them from doing so. owing to divine
~~inspiration, he had seen the hidden hand of the devil behind their
~~abrupt actions. we have only one way to escape the devil, that is, on
~~such occasions we should first pronounce the name of allah. second, this
~~hadith enlightens us on table manners calling for decency and decorum.
~~it will be called an act of sheer indecency to voraciously pounce upon
~~food as is commonly witnessed in feasts and weddings. indeed, it is the
~~result of deviation from islamic teachings that many muslims have grown
~~ignorant of the prophet's manner of eating. allah, too, has left them
~~unrestrained in their beast-like hunger. PageV01P0926

~~hurairah (may allah be pleased with him) reported: messenger of allah
~~(pbuh) said, "when any of you is invited to a meal, he should accept the
~~invitation. if he is observing saum (fasting), he should supplicate for
~~the betterment of the host and if he is not fasting, he should eat.''
~~muslim]. commentary: shari`ah permits a person to break a voluntary
~~fasting. the example of messenger of allah (pbuh) clearly shows that it
~~is not binding on him to keep it again as a redeeming step. a man is,
~~therefore, free to break his voluntary fasting and participate in the
~~feast to which he is invited. however, if somebody is reluctant to break
~~the fast, he should pray for the good and welfare of the host. but we
~~should refuse to attend such treats which are flagrantly masked by
~~extravagance and frivolous un-islamic rites to the disobedience of
~~allah. PageV01P0935

# عن أبي مسعود البدري رضي الله عنه قال : دعا رجل النبي صلى الله عليه و

~~عليه و سلم : [ إن هذا تبعنا فإن شئت أن تأذن وإن شئت رجع ] قال : بل آذن
~~له يا رسول الله . متفق عليه 739. abu mas`ud al-badri (may allah be
~~pleased with him) reported: a man prepared some food especially for the
~~prophet (pbuh) and invited him along with four others. but a man
~~accompanied him. having arrived at the door, messenger of allah (pbuh)
~~said to the host, "this person has followed us. you may allow him, if
~~you like, and if you like he will return.'' he said: "o messenger of
~~allah, i allow him, too.'' [al-bukhari and muslim]. commentary: it will
~~be considered an expression of bad manners if somebody participates in a
~~feast as an uninvited, parasitic guest. yet, he stands a chance in case
~~he is allowed by the host. in this hadith, there is a case when
~~messenger of allah (pbuh) said to the host that it was up to him to let
~~the uninvited person to stay for food or go. however, the invitees may
~~take along with them two or three uninvited guests if they believe that

~~of his father: a man ate with his left hand in the presence of messenger
~~of allah (pbuh), whereupon he said, "eat with your right hand.'' the man
~~said: "i cannot do that.'' thereupon he (the prophet (pbuh)) said, "may
~~you not be able to do that.'' it was vanity that prevented him from

~~manners in our focus and also to urge others to observe them.
~~furthermore, it is extremely undesirable to deny a reality out of sheer

~~carried by four men. one day, when the companions finished their duha
~~(forenoon optional) prayer, al-gharra' was brought full of sopped bread,

~~will be blessed.'' [abu dawud]. commentary: here, too, we are told to

~~by reclining? there is a difference of opinion on it. some say that it
~~means leaning on one side, whether right or left, or against the wall.
~~imam al-khattabi takes it in this sense that somebody should lay out a
~~mattress and sit on it comfortably as one sits cross-legged. messenger

~~middle finger) and licking them after having finished the food.
~~[muslim]. commentary: to use less than three fingers for eating speaks
~~of the manner of the arrogant, whereas to use both hands to this end is

~~(pbuh) commanded the licking of fingers and the gleaning of the dish,
~~saying, "you do not know in which portion the blessing lies.'' [muslim].
~~commentary: this hadith underlines the wisdom behind licking the fingers
~~and the vessel. the eater never knows whether a blessing underlies what
~~has been eaten by him, or the particles sticking to his fingers and
~~vessels contain it. those particles, therefore, should not be wasted;
~~they should be made part of food by being licked. they may be invested
~~with a blessing and proved more useful for the eater's health and

~~it up and remove any of the dirt on it and then eat it, and should not
~~leave it for satan nor should wipe his hand with towel until he has
~~licked his fingers, for he does not know in what portion of the food the
~~blessing lies.'' [muslim]. commentary: this hadith tells us to pick up a
~~fallen morsel and eat it after cleaning the dirt that may have stuck on
~~it. this marks the expression of humility overcoming satan as well as
~~getting the blessing. present-day muslims hardly care for this directive
~~of messenger of allah (pbuh) because they think that this act will bring
~~disgrace and dishonour upon them. to make matters worse, they throw away
~~a large quantity of unconsumed food in street dumps and dunghills and
~~drains. they even deem it necessary to leave over some food in plates
~~and dishes, still less of licking them. what a pity, the muslim
~~community has gone far away from the teachings and excellent example of

~~(may allah be pleased with him) reported: messenger of allah (pbuh)

~~satan, nor should he wipe his hand with the towel until he has licked
~~his fingers, for he does not know in what portion of the food the
~~blessing lies.'' [muslim]. commentary: a muslim should be perpetually on
~~his guard against satanic insinuations, even at mealtime. he is required
~~to recite the name of allah in the very beginning so that he may be
~~immune from satanic participation and mischief. if a man avoids picking
~~up the fallen morsel, he will be providing satan and his minions a
~~chance to share food with him. so we seek the refuge of allah from the
~~condemned satan and his associates. PageV01P0956

~~life of the companions was simple, divested of all kinds of luxuries and
~~comforts. they lived on whatever was available to them. second, a man's
~~ablution is not nullified by eating a cooked food. in the early days of

~~third, if a handkerchief, or a towel or water is not available, a man
~~can (after taking a meal) clean his mouth and hands with his palms and

~~(pbuh) visited me and drank some water from a hanging water-skin while
~~he was in a standing posture. so, i stood up and cut off the mouth (of

~~commentary: on the basis of this hadith, some argue that red dress is

~~however, many `ulama' believe that the dress of messenger of allah
~~(pbuh) was not all red but had red stripes. they, therefore, maintain
~~that the red clothes which women wear are not permissible to men. some
~~`ulama' think that a ruling on this issue will be on condition of space

~~colour, it will be banned for muslim men because of its relevance to
~~disbelief and womanishness. yet, it will be allowed to muslim men in a

~~clothes is permissible to men but forbidden in public. to sum up, the
~~red-coloured dress is not itself a taboo with regard to men. a ruling on
~~it will be conditional in accordance with the situation. for example, in
~~the eastern society the red-coloured dress is usually worn by women and

~~following the movement of his (bilal's) face to the right and to the
~~left when he recited: `come to the prayer; come to the success.' then a

~~then stepped forward and led the prayer. dogs and donkeys passed in
~~front of him (beyond the spear) and no one prevented them from doing so.
~~[al-bukhari and muslim]. commentary: `al-abtah' is the name of a place
~~which is also called the muhassab valley. lexically `al-abtah' means a
~~sloping ground. since it was the passage of rainy water owing to its
~~downward slope, it came to be known by this name. here the prophet
~~(pbuh) encamped in a tent. this hadith provides for wearing red-coloured
~~clothes as mentioned in detail in the preceding hadith. second, it
~~points out an issue concerning the ritual prayer. the worshipper should

~~حسن 790. asma` bint yazid (may allah be pleased with her) reported: the

~~[abu dawud and at-tirmidhi]. commentary: this hadith simply tells us
~~that messenger of allah (pbuh) used to wear a qamees with long sleeves
~~(up to the wrist); but in the case of all the other clothes, apart from
~~the qamees, the sleeves should not go beyond the finger tips.

# وعن ابن عمر رضي الله عنه أن النبي صلى الله عليه و سلم قال : [ من جر
~~ثوبه خيلاء لم ينظر الله إليه يوم القيامة ] فقال أبو بكر : يا رسول الله
~~إن إزاري يسترخي إلا أن أتعاهده . فقال رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم : [
~~إنك لست ممن يفعله خيلاء ] رواه البخاري وروى مسلم بعضه 791. ibn `umar
~~(may allah be pleased with him) reported: the prophet (pbuh) said,
~~"whoever allows his lower garment to drag out of vanity will find that
~~allah will not look at him on the day of resurrection.'' on this abu
~~bakr (may allah be pleased with him) submitted: "o messenger of allah!
~~my lower garment keeps sliding down though i take care to pull it and
~~wrap it.'' messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "you are not of those who do
~~it out of vanity.'' [al-bukhari]. commentary: messenger of allah (pbuh)
~~has given a severe warning to those who intentionally wear a dress which
~~is dragging along the ground because this is a sign of arrogance. yet,
~~if a person's garment unintentionally slips downward he will not be put
~~to accountability. PageV01P1008

~~hurairah (may allah be pleased with him) reported: messenger of allah
~~(pbuh) said, "on the day of resurrection, allah will not look at him who
~~trails his lower garment out of pride.'' [al-bukhari and muslim].
~~commentary: a disregard of allah's favours and gifts means
~~ungratefulness which is essentially manifested in a haughty attitude. it
~~is also a sign of arrogance that one wears a dress with the hem trailing
~~on the ground. PageV01P1009

~~be pleased with him) reported: the prophet (pbuh) said, "what is below
~~the ankles of a lower garment is condemned to the fire (hell).'' [al-
~~bukhari]. commentary: the apparent sense of the hadith words is that the
~~part of the dress hanging down below the ankles will be put into hell-
~~fire. yet, if this is the fate of the particular piece of cloth the
~~wearer will surely go to hell. when nafi` (may allah be pleased with
~~him) was asked about it he said, "yes, but what sins have the clothes
~~committed?'' PageV01P1010

~~"there are three to whom allah will neither speak on the day of
~~resurrection nor will look at them nor purify them (i.e., of their
~~sins), and they will be severely tormented.'' when he repeated this
~~(statement) thrice, abu dharr (may allah be pleased with him) said:
~~"they are doomed and destroyed! (but) who are they, o messenger of allah
~~(pbuh)?'' he said, "one whose lower garment trails, one who boasts of
~~kindness shown to another; and one who promotes sale of his business by
~~taking false oaths.'' [muslim]. commentary: this hadith sheds light on
~~three major sins which, unfortunately, prevail in muslim societies. may
~~allah amend the lapses of muslims' behaviour! PageV01P1011

~~be pleased with them) reported: the prophet (pbuh) said, "on the day of
~~resurrection, allah will not look at one who trails his lower garment,
~~qamees or turban arrogantly.'' [abu dawud and an-nasa'i]. commentary:
~~this hadith tells us if trousers and pajamas, out of pride etc., hang
~~loose below the ankles, the wearer will be committing a grave blunder.
~~the excessive hang of shirt or turban out of pride is also a sign of
~~arrogance and involves the wearer in a major sin. wearing long garments
~~without the intention of pride is disliked. PageV01P1012

# وعن أبي جري جابر بن سليم رضي الله عنه قال : رأيت رجلا يصدر الناس عن

~~فيه فإنما وبال ذلك عليه ] رواه أبو داود والترمذي بإسناد صحيح وقال
~~الترمذي حديث حسن صحيح 796. abu juraiy jabir bin sulaim (may allah be
~~pleased with him) reported: i noticed a man whose opinion was followed
~~by every body, and no one acted contrary to what he said. i asked who he
~~was, and i was informed that he was messenger of allah (pbuh). i said to
~~him twice: "alaikas-salam ya rasul-allah (may allah render you safe).''
~~he said, "do not say: `alaikas-salamu.' this is the salutation to the
~~dead (in jahiliyyah times). say, instead: `as-salamu `alaika (may allah
~~render you safe).''' i asked: "are you messenger of allah?'' he replied,
~~"(yes) i am the messenger of allah, who will remove your affliction when
~~you are in trouble and call to him, who will cause food to grow for you
~~when you are famine-stricken and call to him, and who will restore to
~~you your lost riding beast in the desert when you call upon him.'' i
~~said to him: "give me instructions (to act upon).'' he ((pbuh) said, "do
~~not abuse anyone.'' (since then i have never abused anyone, neither a
~~freeman, nor a slave, nor a camel, nor a sheep). he (pbuh) continued,
~~"do not hold in contempt even an insignificant act of goodness, because
~~even talking to your brother with a cheerful countenance is an act of
~~goodness. hold up your lower garment half way to the leg, and at least
~~above the ankles; for trailing it is arrogance, and allah dislikes
~~pride. and if a man imputes to you of bad things he knows you possess,
~~do not impute to him bad things that you know he has for he will assume
~~the evil consequences of his abuse.'' [abu dawud and at-tirmidhi].
~~commentary: herein, we are informed that the companions of messenger of
~~allah (pbuh) would lend a ready ear to the prophet's advice and put it
~~into practice resolutely. besides, in islam the greeting of peace or
~~salam is alike to the living as well as the dead. the hadith also tells
~~us about the desirable length of izar or lower garment. shari`ah allows
~~it up to the ankles, but if it goes below, the wearer will be involved
~~in a serious transgression incurring hell-fire as mentioned earlier.
~~second, any good act, however small it may be, must not be
~~underestimated and ignored. at no cost should it be given up. third,
~~nobody should be reproached for his fault or mistake, that is, he should
~~not be put to humiliation in public for it. however, in private
~~conversation he may be advised to improve his behaviour and desist from
~~repeating his mistake. PageV01P1013

~~perform your wudu' again.'' that man went and came back having performed
~~it. the messenger of allah (pbuh) said (again), "go and perform your

# 798. qais bin bishr at-taghlibi reported that his father, who attended
~~the company of `abud-darda' (may allah be pleased with him) told him:
~~there was a man in damascus who was a companion of the messenger of
~~allah (pbuh). he was called ibn al-hanzaliyyah. he was a lonesome person
~~and would rarely spend some time in the company of people. he would
~~spend most of his time in performing salat and when he finished, he
~~would engage himself in tasbih (subhan-allah) and takbir (allahu akbar),
~~till he would go home. he passed by us one day when we were sitting with
~~abud-darda' (may allah be pleased with him). the latter said to him:
~~"tell us something which will benefit for us and will not harm you.'' he
~~said: "messenger of allah (pbuh) sent a detachment. when they returned,
~~one of them came to the assemblage in which messenger of allah (pbuh)
~~was present and said to his neighbour during the conversation: `i wish
~~you had seen us when we encountered the enemy. so-and-so (a believer)
~~took up his spear, struck and said: take this from me and i am the
~~ghifari boy. now what do you think of this?' the neighbour said: `i
~~think that he lost his reward because of boasting.' he said: `i see no
~~harm in it.' they began to exchange arguments till messenger of allah
~~(pbuh) heard them and said, `subhan-allah (allah is free from every
~~imperfection). he would be rewarded (in the hereafter) and praised (in
~~this world)'. i noticed that abud-darda' (may allah be pleased with him)
~~felt a great pleasure at this remark and, raising his head began to
~~repeat: "have you heard messenger of allah (pbuh) say this!'' ibn al-
~~hanzaliyyah (may allah be pleased with him) continued responding till i
~~asked abud-darda' (may allah be pleased with him) not to annoy him. ibn
~~al-hanzaliyyah (may allah be pleased with him) happened to pass by us
~~another day and abud-darda' said to him: "tell us something which will
~~benefit us and will not harm you.'' he said: "the messenger of allah
~~(pbuh) told us, `he who spends to purchase a horse (for jihad) is like
~~one who extends his hand for spending out of charity without withholding
~~it.''' he passed by us another day and abud-darda' (may allah be pleased
~~with him) said to him: "tell us something which might benefit us, and
~~will not harm you.'' he said: "the messenger of allah (pbuh) once said,
~~`khuraim al-usaidi is an excellent man were it not of his long hair and
~~his lower garment which is hanging down.' when khuraim heard about what
~~the prophet had said about him, he trimmed his long hair up to his ears
~~with a knife and raised his lower garment half way on his shanks.'' on
~~another occasion he passed by us and abud-darda' (may allah be pleased
~~with him) said to him: "tell us something that will benefit us and will
~~not harm you.'' he said that he heard messenger of allah (pbuh) say,
~~while coming back from an expedition: "you are returning to your
~~brothers, so set your saddles and clothes in order so that you look tidy
~~and graceful. allah hates untidiness.'' [abu dawud]. commentary: this
~~hadith talks about six points. first, a war cry expressive of one's
~~chivalrous deeds and designed to intimidate the enemy is permissible.
~~second, it is not an impeachable act and will be rewarded by allah if it
~~is done with a good intention. third, hair should be grown either up to
~~the earlobes or up to the neck-end as was the prophet's practice. the
~~prophet (pbuh) disapproved the long hair upon the shoulders. fourth, on
~~return from a journey, a man is advised to clean up his appearance and
~~dust-covered clothes; due to the fatigue and dust of journey, he may
~~appear untidy and out of shape. with his ruffled hair and run-down face,
~~whether intentional or unintentional, he will perhaps give a depressive
~~impression to his wife and children and other family members to the
~~displeasure of allah. fifth, we may sympathetically allude to the minor
~~shortcomings of a person in his absence for the sake of his moral
~~uplifting. this will not be considered as backbiting. messenger of allah
~~(pbuh) talked about khuraim al-usaidi (may allah be pleased with him) in
~~the same spirit. sixth, indecency which means something ugly and
~~disgraceful is taken here in an untidy and dishevelled sense which is
~~against aesthetic principles. PageV01P1015

~~الله إليه ] رواه أبو داود بإسناد صحيح 799. abu sa`id al-khudri (may
~~allah be pleased with him) reported: messenger of allah (pbuh) said,
~~"the lower garment of a believer should be half way below the knees. he
~~is guilty of no sin if they are up to the ankles. that which is below
~~the ankles is in the fire (of hell). allah will not look at one who
~~allows his lower garment to trail out of vanity. [abu dawud].
~~commentary: this hadith says that a garment like trousers, pajamas,
~~etc., should, properly speaking, go down up to the middle of the shanks.
~~however, it is permissible to lower it up to the ankles which should
~~remain uncovered. this commandment is for men alone. on the contrary,
~~women are required to cover not only their ankles but also their feet,
~~particularly when they go out. PageV01P1016

~~lifted it up and he told me to raise it higher. i complied with his
~~orders and as i was still trying to find the best place (for it), one of

~~see the sign of his bounties on his slave.'' [at-tirmidhi]. commentary:
~~a simple dress is commendable if one wears it as a gesture of humility

~~to extend a helping hand to the indigent and the needy, to behave
~~favourably towards one's relatives and to wear a fine dress as a
~~manifestation of allah's favours are equally good acts of high merit. a
~~fine dress is not impeachable in itself but it becomes so, if worn with
~~an air of arrogance and self-importance. on the other hand, an
~~expression of divine bounty makes it praiseworthy. in other words, it is
~~the intention which makes an act good or bad. alongside the practice of
~~the example of messenger of allah (pbuh), the sincerity of action and
~~making right intention, therefore, become indispensable. PageV01P1023

~~[al-bukhari and muslim]. commentary: it is not women but men who have
~~been forbidden to wear silk dress. it is banned for men due to its
~~aspect of adornment and beautification which is peculiar to women alone.
~~the silk dress is not befitting to men because it affects their typical
~~characteristics such as bravery, strength and fearlessness. second, it
~~betrays arrogance and haughtiness which is condemnable by all norms of
~~morality. third, it has relevance to disbelievers and polytheists known

~~mu`awiyah (may allah be pleased with him) reported: messenger of allah
~~(pbuh) said, "do not ride on saddles made from silk or leopard's skin.''
~~[abu dawud]. commentary: this hadith prohibits muslim men from using fur
~~and the leopard's hide. in fact the non-muslim contemporaries of the
~~prophet (pbuh) used to wear them. since, they had an epicurean
~~lifestyle, unconcerned about the hereafter, the muslims were dissuaded
~~from emulating their example. the motive behind the ban by messenger of
~~allah (pbuh) was to help believers in acquiring a sense of taqwa
~~(consciousness of allah/fear of allah). as for pure silk, muslim men are
~~totally disallowed to use it. even the saddle-cloth must not be of silk.
~~the same rule applies to any usable thing made from the leopard's hide
~~because it is expressive of arrogance and also bears resemblance to the
~~non-muslim way of life. PageV01P1034

~~authority of his father reported: messenger of allah (pbuh) prohibited
~~the use of the skins of wild animals. [abu dawud, at-tirmidhi and an-

~~forbade the use of the skins of wild animals in making firash (i.e.,
~~something to sit on or lie down on, such as cushions, pillows, covers,
~~spreads, saddles, etc.). commentary: the messenger of allah (pbuh) has
~~forbidden the use of hide of wild beasts. explaining the ban by
~~messenger of allah (pbuh), some say that even the tanning process cannot
~~wipe out hair from a beast's hide. as a result it retains some impurity.
~~others think that the prohibitive order is related only to the untanned
~~hides and is inapplicable to the tanned ones. this opinion also goes
~~since such hides are used by extravagant and arrogant people, and its
~~use by muslims may hold them analogous to the former. but imam ash-
~~shaukani is of the view that the hides of beasts, whether tanned or
~~untanned, must not be used. we also have in view the saying of messenger
~~of allah (pbuh): "tanning purifies every hide.'' yet, in the light of
~~the current hadith it will be considered as specific. the hides of
~~beasts will remain unclean and unusable in all circumstances.

~~sit between two persons, offers the prayer that is prescribed for him
~~and listens to the imam silently, his sins between this friday and the
~~previous friday will be forgiven.'' [al-bukhari]. commentary: this
~~hadith highlights eight points. first, to take a bath on friday is a
~~matter of commendation. some say this bath is commendable, while others
~~think it is necessary. second, one should take it in the morning or
~~before going to the mosque to offer prayer. third, on this occasion the
~~use of perfume or hair-cream is preferable. fourth, there is a mention
~~of good manners. instead of crossing over the heads of worshippers, one
~~should try to locate an open space and sit there. to thrust oneself
~~between two sitting persons looks awkward. fifth, entry into the mosque
~~should be followed by the performance of two rak`ah prayer, even if the
~~imam is delivering khutbah (religious talk). sixth, an attempt should be
~~made to offer voluntary prayer before the khutbah. seventh, complete
~~silence should be observed during the khutbah to the point that one is
~~not allowed to say to the other person: "keep silent,'' if one does not
~~want to loose reward. eighth, if a man offers his friday prayer by
~~observing the said conditions and prerequisites, his week-long sins will
~~be forgiven by allah. but these are exclusively minor sins including
~~failure in doing one's duty to allah. as regards major sins, the sinner
~~will not be forgiven by allah unless he sincerely repents from the sins.
~~similarly, a man's failure to do his duties towards his fellow-muslim

~~commentary: a senseless, boisterous talk, not related to the life to
~~come, is unprofitable and warrants deprecation. but since it is a small
~~sin, it may be pardoned if one sincerely repents of it. yet, it cannot
~~be classified under the head of major sins and human-right violations

~~prompts man to transgress divine rules and limits, whereas the
~~remembrance of allah prevents him from indulging in backbiting and
~~passing slanderous remarks against people in their absence or
~~reproaching and belittling someone at a meeting. unfortunately, such

~~who are close to his heart and not to such people who may start

~~and attribute fatherhood to somebody else is a major sin, because apart
~~from causing doubts and confusion in people's minds about one's blood,
~~descent and character, this will give rise to social, moral and
~~psychological problems as well. and of the same serious nature is the
~~case where fabricated sayings and acts are attributed to the messenger
~~of allah (pbuh). unfortunately, some unwary `ulama', particularly the
~~story-telling preachers, frequently indulge in uttering fabricated
~~ahadith. the warning equally holds good in case a man narrates a hadith
~~of a weak chain of transmission without pointing to its category. one
~~should, therefore, refrain from recounting all ahadith of such a

# وعن أسماء بنت يزيد رضي الله عنها أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم مر

~~yazid (may allah be pleased with her) reported: the messenger of allah
~~(pbuh) passed through the mosque one day and there was a group of women
~~(about ten of them) sitting in the mosque. he raised his hand to offer
~~greetings. [at-tirmidhi]. commentary: to offer as-salam by the gesture
~~of hand from a distance is forbidden in islam because it is the way of
~~non-muslims. however, it is allowed if words are also uttered along with
~~it. secondly, messenger of allah (pbuh) could greet women because he was
~~sinless and permanently stood under allah's protection. yet, it is not
~~permissible to other men for the fear of provoking temptation. but this
~~hadith can be carried into effect in case one feels that no temptation
~~and evil will be involved in it. for example, a man can greet aged and
~~respectable women. however, salam to young women is not allowed as it
~~can give birth to wickedness. PageV01P1091

~~first?'' the messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "the person nearest to
~~allah (i.e., one who is more obedient and therefore closer to allah will

~~sins of the two believers who shake hands. however, major sins cannot be
~~forgiven without heartfelt repentance with its conditions. as for our
~~duty towards our fellow-humans, it is inescapable, and a failure in this

~~increases, and secondly, their minor sins are pardoned by allah.

~~some say the bowing must not come down to the position as assumed in
~~ruku`. but the hadith imposes a total ban on it. there is no question of
~~more or less degree of bowing, still less of touching the knees and feet
~~of anybody. here embracing has been prohibited too, but the prohibition
~~is effective only if the kissing of hands is also involved. otherwise,
~~some ahadith allow embracing, particularly on return from a journey or
~~when two persons meet after a long time. thirdly, the hadith is
~~absolutely clear on handshake. the question put to the prophet u was

~~rabbina' (with the name of allah, the dust of our ground mixed with the
~~saliva of some of us would cure our patient with the permission of our

~~put his forefinger on earth and then mix his spittle with the dust
~~sticking to it. afterwards, he would put it on the patient's pain-spot
~~or wound and utter the said supplication. this simple act would cure the
~~patient. some believe that it was peculiar only to the prophet (pbuh)

~~jibril (gabriel) came to the prophet (pbuh) and said: "o muhammad
~~(pbuh)! do you feel sick?'' he (pbuh) said, "yes.'' jibril supplicated
~~thus (i.e., he performed ruqyah): "bismillahi arqika, min kulli shay'in
~~yu'dhika, min sharri kulli nafsin aw `ayni hasidi, allahu yashfika,
~~bismillahi arqika. [with the name of allah. i recite over you (to
~~cleanse you) from all that troubles you, and from every harmful mischief
~~and from the evil of the eyes of an envier. allah will cure you; and
~~with the name of allah, i recite over you].'' [muslim]. commentary: this
~~hadith clearly tells us that the prophet (pbuh) was not free from the
~~basic attributes of human nature and occasionally he also fell ill.
~~angel jibril (gabriel) therefore prayed for his health and safety
~~against all those things which could harm him. these prayers should be
~~recited after the prophet's practice. PageV01P1160

~~(there is no true god except allah and allah is greatest)', his rubb
~~responds to him and affirms: `(yes!) there is no true god except i, and
~~i am the greatest.' when he says: `la ilaha illallahu wahdahu la sharika

~~this during his illness and dies, will not be touched by the fire
~~(hell).'' [at-tirmidhu]. commentary: this hadith points out the

~~meaning they have, namely the firm belief in allah, his oneness and
~~glorification; that to him alone we should return, upon him alone we
~~should rely, and to him alone we should express gratefulness. if
~~somebody utters them during his illness, his life is sure to come to an
~~end in a good way, that is, he will go to jannah. PageV01P1161

~~closed them (the eyes) for him and said, "when the soul is taken away,
~~the sight follows it.'' some members of his family began to weep. he
~~(pbuh) said: "do not supplicate for yourselves anything but good, for

~~and grant him a successor from his descendants who remain behind. grant
~~him pardon and us, too. o rubb of the worlds. make his grave spacious
~~for him and give him light in it.'' [muslim]. commentary: when the soul
~~leaves the body, the eyes remain open as if gazing at it. so, the eyes
~~of the dead body should be closed. secondly, one should avoid uttering
~~any imprecation on such occasions as the angels, present on the
~~occasion, say `amin' to it. thirdly, the prophet's example requires the
~~pious persons to visit a bereaved family. condoling them, they should
~~invoke supplication and blessing for the departed soul. besides, they
~~should pray to allah to bless the bereaved with both spiritual and
~~material gains and multiple goodness. supplication, as other ahadith
~~also tell us, is beneficial to the dead person. condolence and
~~supplication is undoubtedly a confirmed practice of the prophet (pbuh).

~~punish for the shedding of tears or the grief of the heart, but punishes
~~or bestows mercy for the utterances of this (and he pointed to his
~~tongue).'' [al-bukhari and muslim]. commentary: under the stress of
~~grief, man becomes heavy-hearted and tears flow out from his eyes. this
~~is something natural and beyond human control. rather the outflow of
~~tears results from divine compassion. this is neither forbidden nor
~~subject to accountability. it is only wailing which is haram, and is
~~punishable. yet, man is blessed with divine mercy if he gives expression
~~to patience and gratefulness by his tongue. moreover, to mention the
~~merits and excellence of a departed soul is in itself a good thing
~~because others may be stimulated to adopt them. but to recount them by
~~way of wailing is disliked. a hadith says that a dead person is
~~tormented because of the weeping of his household. here weeping means
~~lamenting and wailing. otherwise, to weep is human instinct and no curbs
~~can be put over it. besides, this warning is meant for such a person who
~~might have been accustomed to wailing during his lifetime. or he might
~~have left a will to his family for wailing over his death. may be he
~~consciously avoided giving a predeath warning to his kith and kin
~~against wailing. in all the three situations, he will be equally held
~~accountable with his soul being tormented for the wailing of his

~~continued standing for a time equal to an interval between two takbir,
~~praying for her and seeking allah's forgiveness for her.'' then he said:
~~"the messenger of allah (pbuh) used to do so.'' another narration is: he
~~(abdullah) recited four takbir and remained standing in prayer for some
~~time till we thought that he would recite the fifth takbir. then he gave
~~salam on the right and on the left. when he turned aside, we asked him
~~about it. he replied: "i would add nothing to what i saw the messenger
~~of allah (pbuh) doing,'' or he said: "the messenger of allah (pbuh) used
~~to do so.'' [al-hakim]. commentary: all the above mentioned
~~supplications are those which were recited by the prophet (pbuh) in the
~~funeral prayers. it is, therefore, advisable if they are all put
~~together and recited because we are commanded to pray sincerely for a
~~dead body. another point comes to our knowledge about the funeral
~~prayer, that is to say, it may be said aloud as affirmed by the above
~~mentioned ahadith because if the prophet (pbuh) had not offered it
~~aloud, the companions would not have been able to memorize these
~~supplications. thirdly, we are uncertain that after saying a funeral
~~prayer, the prophet ü and his companions ever stood round the bier and
~~supplicated for the dead body. it is an innovation (bid`ah) and must be
~~abolished. we are unauthorized to refer this practice to the prophet
~~(pbuh). it looks strange that believers should persist in reciting
~~supplications in their own self-styled way after the funeral prayer, but
~~desist from them during the funeral prayer to which they have relevance.
~~it implies that prayer is not the object of their pursuit, otherwise
~~they would have prayed in accordance with the sunnah. in fact, they

~~baqi` al-gharqad (graveyard in al-madinah) when the messenger of allah
~~(pbuh) proceeded towards us and sat down. we sat around him. he had a
~~small stick in his hand. he was bending down his head and scraping the
~~ground with the stick. he said, "there is none among you but has a place
~~assigned for him either in the jannah or in the hell.'' the companions
~~said: "o messenger of allah, should we not depend upon what has been
~~written for us (and give up doing good deeds)?'' the messenger of allah
~~(pbuh) said, "carry on doing good deeds. every one will find it easy to
~~do such deeds (as will lead him to his destined place) for which he has
~~been created.'' [al-bukhari and muslim]. commentary: the subject of this
~~chapter is exactly related to the hadith accounting for reasons of
~~giving a sermon speech beside the grave. as the dimension of the world's
~~impermanent nature and a heart-moving scene directly confront a man's
~~eyes on this occasion, any moral exhortation is most likely to touch the
~~heart. secondly, the good or bad deeds of man during his fixed life span
~~in this world prefigure in allah's knowledge, and he has ordained the
~~good or bad end of everybody. but this does not mean that man is simply
~~helpless in doing what allah has predetermined. indeed, allah already
~~knows that such and such a person will adopt the righteous conduct and
~~meet a good end; and such and such a person will take to the mischievous
~~way and consequently meet a bad end. unless man has access to allah's
~~knowledge and the preserved tablet (which is impossible), he is not
~~supposed to give up the right conduct by banking upon his knowledge.
~~when he is totally ignorant of the sacred writ on his ultimate end, he
~~has no other choice but to continue endeavouring in good pursuits. allah
~~has given him the freedom of choice and will subject him to
~~accountability on this count alone. moreover, it is the divine principle
~~that he helps everybody do only that type of work - facilitating it to
~~him as well - which is germane to his bent of mind. then, there is no
~~reason that man should lag behind in embarking upon the virtuous path
~~and not try to seek the grace of allah. PageV01P1214

~~reported: a man said to the prophet (pbuh): "my mother has died
~~suddenly. i think that if she were able to talk (alive) she would have
~~given in sadaqah (charity). so, if i give sadaqah now on her behalf,
~~will she get the reward?'' the messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "yes (she
~~will be rewarded for that).'' [al-bukhari and muslim]. commentary: this
~~hadith plainly tells us that the reward of the alms given on behalf of a
~~dead person reaches his or her soul just like the benefit of prayer, if
~~accepted by allah. charity and prayer are two permissible forms of the
~~transmission of blessing to the dead. but rites like `qul' and `chehlum'
~~are all of hindu origin to which the ignorant muslims have taken a
~~fancy. similarly, qur'an reading meant to transmit reward to a dead
~~man's soul is against the prophet's example. all such observances are of
~~no use to the dead. only scriptural channels can be beneficial to them
~~and they are only two - prayer and charity. but only that charity counts
~~which comes from the children of the dead and the hadith too has
~~specified it. obviously, almsgiving by any other person than the
~~offspring cannot be considered rightful or rewarding to the dead. for
~~further detail, one can refer to sheikh al-albani's ahkam-ul-janaiz.

# وعن أبي هريرة رضي الله عنه أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم قال : [
~~إذا مات الإنسان انقطع عمله إلا من ثلاث : صدقة جارية أو علم ينتفع له أو
~~ولد صالح يدعو له ] رواه مسلم 949. abu hurairah (may allah be pleased
~~with him) reported: the messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "when a man
~~dies, his deeds come to an end, except for three: a continuous charity,
~~knowledge by which people derive benefit, pious son who prays for him.''
~~[muslim]. commentary: a thoughtful reflection of this hadith will reveal
~~that the three things are indeed man's own good deeds which somehow
~~continue to exist even after his death. for example, places like a
~~hospital, a mosque, a religious school and a well built by a man
~~continue to operate like a trust as traces of his activity in earthly
~~life. to quote the qur'an: "and we record that which they send before
~~(them), and their traces [their footsteps and walking on the earth with
~~their legs to the mosques for the five compulsory congregational
~~prayers, jihad (holy fighting in allah's cause) and all other good and
~~evil they did, and that which they leave behind].'' (36:12) so long as
~~they exist and people benefit from them, the dead person will keep
~~receiving his due reward. the same is pertinent to the spread of
~~knowledge of islamic disciplines to people's moral uplift. for instance,
~~if during his lifetime he wrote books based on qur'an and hadith,
~~advocated the cause of islam, instructed lots of pupils in islamic
~~teachings, it will be counted as an unending activity on his part. to
~~quote a hadath: "the one who called people to adopt the right path will
~~receive reward in the same measure as did those who had the good fortune
~~to follow him.'' besides, this hadith tells us that, after his death,
~~man will receive reward by the prayers of his virtuous children, and
~~other ahadith too confirm it. this clears the issue of sending the fruit
~~of good works to the welfare of a dead person's soul. charity or the
~~continual charity from the part of a dead person himself, beneficial
~~(religious) knowledge and prayer are acts of sunnah under this rule.
~~with the exception of these, all other deeds do not benefit the dead.
~~however, if the dead person was under obligation to perform hajj or had
~~missed obligatory or vowed fasts, his heirs are commanded by the prophet
~~(pbuh) to observe them on his behalf. because this is like a debt
~~payable by the dead person and his heirs are under obligation to
~~discharge it for him. yet, this rule is inapplicable to other forms of
~~physical worship. PageV01P1221

# وعن أبي جعفر عبد الله بن جعفر رضي الله عنه قال : أردفني رسول الله صلى
~~الله عليه و سلم ذات يوم خلفه وأسر إلي حديثا لا أحدث به أحدا من الناس .
~~وكان أحب ما استتر به رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم لحاجته هدف أو حائش
~~نخل . يعني حائط نخل . رواه مسلم هكذا مختصرا وزاد فيه البرقاني بإسناد
~~مسلم هذا بعد قوله حائش نخل : فدخل حائطا لرجل من الأنصار فإذا فيه جمل
~~فلما رأى رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم جرجر وذرفت عيناه . فأتاه النبي
~~صلى الله عليه و سلم فمسح سراته ( أي سنامه ) وذفراه فسكن فقال : [ من رب
~~هذا الجمل لمن هذا الجمل ؟ ] فجاء فتى من الأنصار فقال : هذا لي يا رسول
~~الله . فقال : [ أفلا تتقي الله في هذه البهيمة التي ملكك الله إياها فإنه
~~يشكو إلي أنك تجيعه وتدئبه ] ورواه أبو داود كرواية البرقاني قوله [ ذفراه
~~] هو بكسر الذال المعجمة وإسكان الفاء وهو لفظ مفرد مؤنث . قال أهل اللغة :
~~الذفرى الموضع الذي يعرق من البعير خلف الأذن وقوله [ تدئبه ] : أي تتعبه
~~967. abu ja`far `abdullah bin ja`far (may allah be pleased with them)
~~reported: the messenger of allah (pbuh) made me ride behind him one day
~~and confided something to me which i shall never disclose to anyone.
~~(`abdullah added:) he ((pbuh) preferred to screen himself from others
~~when responding to the call of nature, either behind a wall or the trunk
~~of a date-palm. [muslim]. al-barqani added: the messenger of allah
~~(pbuh) entered an orchid belonging to an ansari and saw there a camel.
~~when it saw him, it began to groan and its eyes shed tears. the
~~messenger of allah (pbuh) approached it and patted it on the hump and
~~the base of its head until it quieted down. then he (pbuh) asked, "who
~~is the owner of this camel? to whom does it belong?'' an ansari youth
~~stepped forward and said: "it is mine o messenger of allah!'' he said,
~~"do you not fear allah in respect of this beast which allah has placed
~~in your possession? this camel is complaining to me that you starve it
~~and put it to toil.'' [abu dawud]. commentary: the prophet (pbuh) must
~~have divulged to the companion something confidential for which he
~~promised secrecy. otherwise, anything concerning the shari`ah should not
~~be concealed. second, if an animal has the capacity to carry two men,
~~the rider can let another person sit behind him. third, to give scanty
~~food to an animal and to get the maximum out of it amounts to injustice.
~~islam disapproves this act. animals should be fed to their fill and the
~~amount of work to be done by them must also be not beyond their
~~capacity. in this hadith, there is a mention of the prophet's miracle
~~that a camel recognized him. he heard the camel's complaint and also
~~understood it. PageV01P1247

# وعن أبي سعيد الخدري رضي الله عنه قال : بينما نحن في سفر إذ جاء رجل
~~على راحلة له فجعل يصرف بصره يمينا وشمالا . فقال رسول الله صلى الله عليه
~~و سلم : [ من كان معه فضل ظهر فليعد به على من لا ظهر له ومن كان له فضل
~~زاد فليعد به على من لا زاد له ] فذكر من أصناف المال ما ذكر حتى رأينا أنه
~~لا حق لأحد منا في فضل . رواه مسلم 969. abu sa`id al-khudri (may allah be
~~pleased with him) reported: while we were travelling with the messenger
~~of allah (pbuh), a rider came and began to stare on the right and on the
~~left. the messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "he who has an extra mount
~~should hand it over to one who has none, and he who possesses surplus
~~provision, should give it to him who is without provision.'' he named
~~various kinds of possessions until we began to think (realize) that none
~~of us had any right to anything surplus. [muslim]. commentary: nowadays,
~~there is a great fanfare of money-lending institutions such as
~~cooperative societies, the financing companies and insurance companies
~~which are apparently helpful in resolving the financial crises of
~~people. but all are rooted in interest system which is rejected outright
~~by islam for its exploitative nature. these so-called cooperative
~~institutions are indeed like blood-sucking leeches which ruin man.
~~islam, on the contrary, has given us a positive, simple and man-
~~orientated formula of mutual cooperation. it teaches us that what can be
~~spared should be given to those who need it. this obviates the chances
~~of hoarding as well as the concentration of wealth in a few hands. no
~~doubt, it is a moral instruction. but if muslims, called as a single
~~body, develop a true sense and awareness of it, wonderful results can
~~accrue from it on a large social scale. what is more, the sublimity of
~~man's faith and moral behaviour stands on it. one who is indifferent to
~~the perfection of faith and morality may set it aside. but a man who
~~rates faith above everything can hardly afford to avoid putting this
~~moral advice into practice. PageV01P1251

~~ولا عشيرة فليضم أحدكم إليه الرجلين والثلاثة فما لأحدنا من ظهر يحمله إلا
~~عقبة كعقبة ] يعني أحدهم قال : فضممت إلي اثنين أو ثلاثة ما لي إلا عقبة
~~كعقبة أحدهم من جملي . رواه أبو داود 970. jabir (may allah be pleased
~~with him) reported: when the messenger of allah (pbuh) made up his mind
~~to go in an expedition, he would say to us, "o muhajirin and the ansar!
~~there are among you such people who have no property and no kinsfolk.
~~let everyone of you take along with him two or three men. none of us had
~~a spare animal we took rides by turn.'' so i took two or three men with
~~me and i rode my camel by turn equally with them. [abu dawud].
~~commentary: firstly, this hadith describes the companions' condition in
~~the early phase of islam. everybody participating in jihad did not have
~~an animal and so was the condition in respect of weapons and food. but
~~in spite of all that, the companions' zeal for jihad was great.
~~secondly, it presents the picture of mutual cooperation which the

~~commentary: the prophet (pbuh) sought divine refuge against the
~~supplication of the oppressed because allah immediately responds to it.
~~it is, therefore, imperative that if a man has wronged anybody, he
~~should recompense his wrongdoing before embarking on a journey because

~~matters little and the real point is the length of distance to be called
~~journey. a woman is not allowed to travel unless she is accompanied by
~~her husband or a mahram. second, hajj is obligatory on her provided she
~~has no financial problem. if a woman has no husband or mahram, hajj is
~~not obligatory on her. neither can she go for hajj with a group of
~~women, whether for hajj or any other purpose. third, the term mahram,
~~apart from husband, applies to all of her male siblingss whom she cannot
~~marry; these include the father, the son, the brother, the nephew, the
~~son-in-law and the foster-father. she cannot travel with anybody but
~~with any of these. fourth, when she goes out, she should wear a jilbab
~~(an outer gown) dress so that no part of her body should be visible.
~~moreover, perfume must not be used by her, wearing perfume in public by
~~women is tantamount to fornication, nor should the jingling of her

~~secondly, the descending of tranquillity from allah on the pious
~~persons. the appearance of a cloud for the tranquillity of heart on the

~~this hadith means that the heart of that muslim is devoid of grace of

~~commentary: this hadith mentions the merit of those who commit the

~~here means to rise in ranks in the jannah. the more one remembers the
~~qur'an, the more clear and distinct is his recitation of it, the higher
~~would be the status that he will go on attaining through its blessings.

~~عليه و سلم : [ ألا أعلمك أعظم سورة في القرآن قبل أن تخرج من المسجد ؟ ]
~~فأخذ بيدي فلما أردنا أن نخرج قلت : يا رسول الله إنك قلت لأعلمنك أعظم
~~سورة في القرآن ؟ قال : [ الحمد لله رب العالمين هي السبع المثاني والقرآن
~~العظيم الذي أوتيته ] رواه البخاري 1009. abu sa`id ar-rafi` bin al-
~~mu`alla (may allah be pleased with him) reported: the messenger of allah
~~(pbuh) said, "shall i teach you the greatest surah in the qur'an before
~~you leave the mosque?'' then he (pbuh), took me by the hand, and when we
~~were about to step out, i reminded him of his promise to teach me the
~~greatest surah in the qur'an. he (pbuh) said, "it is `alhamdu lillahi
~~rabbil `alamin (i.e., surat al-fatihah) which is as-sab` al-mathani
~~(i.e., the seven oft-repeated ayat) and the great qur'an which is given
~~to me.'' [al-bukhari]. commentary: allah the almighty says: "and indeed,
~~we have bestowed upon you seven of al-mathani (the seven repeatedly
~~recited ayat), (i.e., surat al-fatihah) and the grand qur'an.'' (15:87).
~~this hadith is an elaboration of the quranic ayah quoted above. the
~~prophet (pbuh) held that as-sab` al-mathani is surat al-fatihah (the
~~opening chapter) because these seven ayat are recited not only in every
~~salat but in every rak`ah of every salat for the reason that no salat is
~~valid without the recitation of this surah, as is evident from the
~~saying of the prophet (pbuh): "the salat of that person who has not
~~recited surat al-fatihah is void.'' it has also been regarded as the
~~greatest surah of the qur'an as it covers all the objects of the qur'an
~~and is a condensation of all the subjects which have been discussed in
~~detail in its other surah. it includes the belief in the tauhid (the
~~belief in the oneness of allah)), the worship of allah, the day of
~~resurrection, promise (of jannah) and warning (against hell-fire),
~~instances of the pious and impious people of the past communities, and
~~the lessons their conduct has for others. abu dawud and at-tirmidhi have
~~reported a hadith in which the messenger of allah (pbuh) said: "al-hamdu
~~lillahi rabbil `alamin (i.e., surat al-fatihah) is umm-ul-qur'an that is
~~its origin, basis and essence". PageV01P1307

# وعن أبي سعيد الخدري رضي الله عنه أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم قال
~~في قل هو الله أحد : [ والذي نفسي بيده إنها لتعدل ثلث القرآن ] وفي رواية
~~: أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم قال لأصحابه : [ أيعجز أحدكم أن يقرأ
~~بثلث القرآن في ليلة ؟ ] فشق ذلك عليهم وقالوا : أينا يطيق ذلك يا رسول
~~الله ؟ فقال : [ قل هو الله أحد الله الصمد ثلث القرآن ] رواه البخاري
~~1010. abu sa`id al-khudri (may allah be pleased with him) reported about
~~surat al-ikhlas (chapter 112): the messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "by
~~him in whose hand my soul is, it is equivalent to one-third of the
~~qur'an.'' according to another version, he (pbuh) said to his
~~companions, "is anyone of you incapable of reciting one-third of the
~~qur'an in one night?'' they considered it burdensome and said: "o
~~messenger of allah, which of us can afford to do that?'' he (pbuh) said,
~~"surat al-ikhlas [say: he is allah (the) one] is equivalent to one-third
~~of the qur'an.'' [al-bukhari]. commentary: one reading of surat al-
~~ikhlas has return and reward equal to the recitation of one-third of the
~~qur'an. this surah mentions the oneness of allah. this is enough to make
~~one realize how much allah (swt) likes the recitation and remembrance of
~~his oneness. this is the reason, he has declared shirk (polytheism) an
~~absolutely unpardonable sin. PageV01P1308

~~pleased with him) reported: a man heard another reciting surat al-ikhlas
~~repeatedly. the next morning he came to the messenger of allah (pbuh)
~~and informed him about it as if he considered it to be of little reward.
~~on that the messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "by him in whose hand my
~~soul is, this surah is equal to one-third of the qur'an.'' [al-bukhari].
~~commentary: "yataqalluha'' means he thought that its recitation had no
~~special merits. the prophet (pbuh) clarified his misunderstanding by
~~elucidating its eminence. PageV01P1309

~~ikhlas [say: he is allah, (the) one].'' he (pbuh) said, "your love for
~~it will admit you to jannah.'' [at-tirmidhi]. commentary: some scholars
~~have highlighted the eminence of surat al-ikhlas by saying that it
~~comprises the whole discipline of tauhid. this surat deals with tauhid.

# وعن عقبة بن عامر رضي الله عنه أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم قال :
~~[ ألم تر آيات أنزلت هذه الليلة لم ير مثلهن قط ؟ قل أعوذ برب الفلق وقل
~~أعوذ برب الناس ] رواه مسلم 1014. `uqbah bin `amir (may allah be pleased
~~with him) reported: the messenger of allah (pbuh) said: "do you not know
~~that last night certain ayat were revealed the like of which there is no
~~precedence. they are: `say: i seek refuge with (allah) the rubb of the
~~daybreak' (surah 113), and `say: i seek refuge with (allah) the rubb of
~~mankind' (surah 114).'' [muslim]. commentary: "alam tara'' means "have
~~not you seen?'' or "are you not aware?'' "there is no precedence'' means
~~that there is no other complete surat in the qur'an on this subject,
~~except these two. for this reason these two surat are called (al-
~~mu`awwidhatain) which means two surat which we use to seek allah's
~~protection. PageV01P1312

# وعن أبي سعيد الخدري رضي الله عنه قال : كان رسول الله صلى الله عليه و
~~سلم يتعوذ من الجان وعين الإنسان حتى نزلت المعوذتان فلما نزلتا أخذ بهما
~~وترك ما سواهما . رواه الترمذي وقال حديث حسن 1015. abu sa`id al-khudri
~~(may allah be pleased with him) reported: the messenger of allah (pbuh)
~~used to seek protection against the evil of jinn and the evil eyes till
~~surat al-falaq and surat an-nas were revealed. after they were revealed,
~~he took to them for seeking allah's protection and left everything
~~besides them. [at-tirmidhi]. commentary: like men, jinns have also good
~~and bad elements among them. almighty allah has endowed them with such
~~power that if they want they can, with the will of allah, harm human
~~beings. this is the reason mischievous jinns harm people. similarly,
~~influence of the evil eye is also true. what it means is that if a
~~person looks at someone with greed and envy, the evil effects of his
~~look will reach the person viewed, and because of that he has to suffer
~~some loss or trouble or accident. for this reason, the prophet (pbuh)
~~would seek the protection of allah against the jinns and the evil eye
~~and pray in his own words for it, saying: "i seek your protection
~~against jinns and evil eyes of the people.'' after the revelation of the
~~surah al-falaq and an-nas (last two surah of the quran) he started
~~reciting them because these were revealed for this purpose. these surah
~~are also called "al-mu`awwidhatain'' which mean two surah which provide
~~protection. it is, therefore, very useful to seek the protection of
~~allah by reciting them. PageV01P1313

# وعن أبي هريرة رضي الله عنه أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم قال : [
~~من القرآن سورة ثلاثون آية شفعت لرجل حتى غفر له وهي : تبارك الذي بيده
~~الملك ] رواه أبو داود الترمذي وقال حديث حسن وفي رواية أبي داود : [ تشفع
~~] 1016. abu hurairah (may allah be pleased with him) reported: i heard
~~the messenger of allah (pbuh) saying, "there is a surah in the qur'an
~~which contains thirty ayat which kept interceding for a man until his
~~sins are forgiven. this surah is `blessed is he in whose hand is the
~~dominion.' (surat al-mulk 67).'' [at-tirmidhi and abu dawud].
~~commentary: this hadith means that on the day of resurrection this surah
~~will intercede with allah for the forgiveness of its reciter. this
~~hadith has been narrated (in arabic) in the past tense because, like the
~~past indefinite, its occurrence is definite and not open to inquiry. at

~~كفتاه المكروه تلك الليلة . وقيل : كفتاه عن قيام الليل 1017. abu mas`ud
~~al-badri (may allah be pleased with him) reported: i heard the prophet
~~(pbuh) saying, "he who recites the two ayat at the end of surat al-
~~baqarah at night, they will suffice him.'' [al-bukhari and muslim].
~~commentary: "suffice him'' here means that he will be protected from the
~~evils. its another meaning is that these two ayat will take the place of
~~tahajjud (optional prayer in the late hours of the night). imam an-
~~nawawi has cited the latter meaning. PageV01P1315

~~reported: i heard the messenger of allah (pbuh) saying: "do not turn
~~your houses into graveyards. satan runs away from the house in which
~~surat al-baqarah is recited.'' [muslim]. commentary: this hadith
~~instructs us not to turn our homes into the like of a graveyard through
~~the negligence of reciting the qur'an in them. it also points out the
~~excellence of surat al-baqarah, which when recited, will certainly keep
~~the devil away. PageV01P1316

# وعن أبي بن كعب رضي الله عنه قال قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم : [

~~إلا هو الحي القيوم } فضرب في صدري وقال : [ ليهنك العلم أبا المنذر ] رواه
~~مسلم 1019. ubayy bin ka`b (may allah be pleased with him) reported: the
~~messenger of allah (pbuh) said: "abu mundhir! do you know which ayah in
~~allah's book is the greatest?'' i replied: "it is `allah la ilaha illa
~~huwal-haiyul-qayum (allah! none has the right to be worshipped but he,
~~the ever living...)'.'' (2:256) thereupon he (pbuh) patted me in the
~~chest and said, "rejoice by this knowledge, o abu mundhir!'' [muslim].
~~commentary: the words cited in the hadith occur at the beginning of
~~ayat-ul-kursi (no. 256 of surat al-baqarah of the qur'an). the merits
~~mentioned in the hadith are for the whole ayah. ayat-ul-kursi mentions
~~the majestic attributes and mighty powers of allah and is, therefore,
~~very meritorious. "rejoice by this knowledge'' means "may this knowledge
~~be a source of respect, honour and benefit to you.'' and knowledge here
~~stands for the knowledge of the qur'an and hadith which is certainly a
~~means of success in this world and the hereafter. PageV01P1317

~~over you from allah, and satan will not be able to approach you till

~~asked me, "what did your prisoner do last night.'' i answered, "he
~~promised to teach me some words which he claimed will benefit me before
~~allah. so i let him go.'' the messenger of allah (pbuh) asked, "what are
~~those words that he taught you?'' i said, "he told me: `when you go to

~~reported: the messenger of allah (pbuh) said: "whoever commits to memory
~~the first ten ayat of the surat al-kahf, will be protected from (the

~~messenger of allah (pbuh) said: "(whoever commits to memory) the last
~~ten ayat of surat al-kahf, he will be protected from (the trial of) ad-
~~dajjal (antichrist).'' commentary: ad-dajjal will appear sometime before

~~powers the manifestation of which will shake the faith of many people.
~~for this reason, this will be a serious trial. all prophets warned their

~~performing wudu' the way i have just done it and said, "he who performs
~~wudu' like this, his previous sins will be forgiven and his salat and
~~walking to the mosque will be considered as supererogatory act of
~~worship.'' [muslim]. commentary: wudu' is a means of remission of minor
~~sins, provided those sins are not related to the rights of people
~~because they too will not be forgiven without penitence and compensating
~~the aggrieved or the wronged. to perform wudu' at home before proceeding
~~to the mosque for salat is highly meritorious. he who does so, will be
~~purged of minor sins. then his going to the mosque and performance of
~~salat there, is a means for gaining further reward. PageV01P1328

~~رواه مسلم 1028. abu hurairah (may allah be pleased with him) reported:
~~the messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "when a muslim, or a believer,
~~washes his face (in the course of wudu'), every sin which he committed
~~with his eyes, will be washed away from his face with water, or with the
~~last drop of water; when he washes his hands, every sin which is
~~committed by his hands will be effaced from his hands with the water, or
~~with the last drop of water; and when he washes his feet, every sin his
~~feet committed will be washed away with the water, or with the last drop
~~of water; until he finally emerges cleansed of all his sins.'' [muslim].
~~commentary: this hadith has the same meaning mentioned in the preceding
~~ahadith. that is to say, such minor sins are washed off by wudu'. in
~~other words, wudu' is a means of purification of the body as well as the

~~went to the (baqi`) cemetery and said, "may you be secured from
~~punishment, o dwellers of abode of the believers! we, if allah wills,
~~will follow you. i wish we see my brothers.'' the companions said, "o
~~messenger of allah! are not we your brothers?'' he (pbuh) said, "you are
~~my companions, but my brothers are those who have not come into the
~~world yet.'' they said; "o messenger of allah! how will you recognize
~~those of your ummah who are not born yet?'' he (pbuh) said, "say, if a
~~man has white-footed horses with white foreheads among horses which are
~~pure black, will he not recognize his own horses?'' they said;
~~"certainly, o messenger of allah!'' he (pbuh) said, "they (my followers)
~~will come with bright faces and white limbs because of wudu'; and i will
~~arrive at the haud (al-kauthar) ahead of them.'' [muslim]. commentary:
~~on the principle "the believers are brothers'' that is manifested in
~~surat al-hujurat of the qur'an (49:10), the prophet (pbuh) regarded all
~~the successive generations of muslims as his brothers. his companions
~~have an added distinction that they are his brothers as well as his
~~companions. this hadith also mentions haud al-kauthar which is awarded
~~to the prophet (pbuh) on the day of requital, and he will give water
~~from it to his followers after which they will never feel thirst. those
~~who invent innovations in religion, will be deprived of this honour, as
~~is evident from other narratives. farat is a person who goes ahead of
~~the others in the caravan and makes arrangements for the encampment and
~~provisions of the caravan. it is a unique distinction of the muslims

~~requital. PageV01P1330

~~ribat means watching the frontiers or battlefront to check the invasion

~~regarded as ribat for the reason that by so doing, a person who is

~~calling people to the worship of allah. mu'adhdhin (the caller) gets
~~reward for the salat of all those who hear his adhan. the phrase "will
~~have the longest necks'' has been given different interpretations. one
~~of them is that they are those who long for the mercy of allah more than
~~anyone else. another interpretation is that their necks will grow longer
~~on the day of requital and so sweat will not reach them, for every one
~~will sweat on that day depending on his deeds: sweat will reach up to

~~prophet (pbuh) means to recite "allahumma salli `ala muhammadin, wa `ala
~~ali muhammadin, kama sallaita `ala ibrahima wa `ala ali ibrahima, innaka
~~hamidun majid.'' wasilah literally means that mode or method by which
~~one attains his goal, but here it stands for that high rank in jannah
~~which will be awarded to the prophet (pbuh). the word shafa`ah means to
~~beg someone to pardon somebody's faults and shortcomings or to request
~~someone for doing a virtuous deed. in the context of this hadith, it

~~night and by day, and they all assemble at the dawn (fajr) and the
~~afternoon (`asr) prayers. those who have spent the night with you,

~~`in what condition did you leave my slaves?' they reply: `we left them
~~while they were performing salat and we went to them while they were
~~performing salat.''' [al-bukhari and muslim]. commentary: the angels for
~~the night come at the time of `asr when the angels for the morning are
~~present. this is how the angels of the two shifts assemble at this time.
~~the angels of the shift of `asr leave their duty in the morning, and the
~~angels of the morning shift resume their duty when the pious persons are
~~engaged in fajr prayer. this is how the two groups assemble again at
~~that time. thus, when the angels come or go, the people who are punctual
~~in their prayer are engaged in fajr and `asr. almighty allah knows
~~everything but even then he asks the angels about his pious slaves so
~~that the piousness of the believers and their merit and distinction
~~become evident to them. PageV01P1355

~~for offering salat in the mosque and brings into eminence the merit of
~~doing so. the merit lies in the fact that one minor sin is pardoned at
~~every step that is taken towards the mosque and one's status (in jannah)
~~is enhanced by one stage. this hadith also mentions the vastness of the

~~we learn from this hadith that the location of the mosque at a long

~~merits at every step when he goes to the mosque and returns from it. not

~~abu hurairah (may allah be pleased with him) reported: the messenger of
~~allah (pbuh) said, "a man's salat in congregation is twenty-five times
~~more rewarding than his salat at home or in his shop, and that is
~~because when he performs his wudu' properly and proceeds towards the
~~mosque with the purpose of performing salat in congregation, he does not
~~take a step without being raised a degree (in rank) for it and having a
~~sin remitted for it, till he enters the mosque. when he is performing
~~salat, the angels continue to invoke blessings of allah on him as long
~~as he is in his place of worship in a state of wudu'. they say: `o
~~allah! have mercy on him! o allah! forgive him.' he is deemed to be
~~engaged in salat as long as he waits for it.'' [al-bukhari and muslim].
~~commentary: this hadith tells us that salat in congregation is far more
~~in reward than salat offered alone. in the preceding hadith it has been
~~held 27 times and in the present, 25 times more rewarding. the reason
~~for this variation offered by some `ulama' is that at first it was told
~~to the prophet (pbuh) 25 times and then it was increased to 27 and he
~~communicated to his companions what was revealed to him. some other
~~scholars have linked it with the form, spirit and concentration of the
~~salat. the more meticulous one is about its details, the greater will be
~~the reward for it. another difference of opinion in this respect is
~~regarding the nature of salat in congregation. how does one become
~~eligible for higher reward? does he become eligible for it by performing
~~salat in congregation anywhere, i.e., at home, in business premises, at
~~an open place, in the desert etc., or in that congregation which gathers
~~in a mosque? some `ulama' go with the first opinion while others agree
~~with the second. hafiz ibn hajar preferred the second view on the
~~grounds that the words occuring in the text of this hadith support this
~~view. PageV01P1373

~~relating to ibn umm maktum are quoted by such people who hold that those
~~who are physically fit, resident and have no valid reason for not coming
~~to the mosque for salat, for them salat in the mosque (jama`ah) is a

~~refer to the hypocrites who did not come to the mosque for salat. some
~~people are of the view that it is sunnah mu'akkadah (an established

~~because if performance of salat in congregation was obligatory, those
~~who missed it would have been punished by the prophet (pbuh), but we do

~~cannot, at the same time, lose sight of the importance that has been
~~attached to the salat in congregation especially the fact that it is 25

~~أثقل على المنافقين من صلاة الفجر والعشاء ولو يعلمون ما فيهما لأتوهما ولو

~~reported: the messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "no salat is more
~~burdensome to the hypocrites than the fajr (dawn) prayer and the `isha'
~~(night) prayer; and if they knew their merits, they would come to them
~~even if they had to crawl to do so.'' [al-bukhari and muslim].
~~commentary: `isha' and fajr prayers were, and still are, very hard for
~~the hypocrites for the reason that they performed salat only to make a
~~show of it and not for the fear of allah. therefore, muslims should not
~~show any laziness in them at all, lest they develop a resemblance with

~~deliberate delay is that one becomes sluggish and begins to ignore and

~~commentary: in this hadith, islam has been compared to a building which
~~rests on five pillars. as a building cannot stand without its

~~allah be pleased with him) reported: the messenger of allah (pbuh) said,
~~"between a man and disbelief and paganism is the abandonment of salat
~~(prayer).'' [muslim]. commentary: he who will be having the quality of
~~islam and will be particular in performing salat regularly, will raise a
~~wall between himself and kufr. he who does not perform salat after
~~coming to the fold of islam, does not have a frontier which separates
~~him from infidelity. leaving salat is like demolishing the wall that
~~separates islam from kufr. thus, we learn from this hadith that leaving
~~salat is kufr. some `ulama' are of the opinion that this injunction is
~~for one who believes leaving salat is permissible whereas the one who
~~leaves it because of slackness is not kafir. some scholars, however,
~~think that if such a person does not repent, he is liable to hadd, i.e.,
~~death punishment. there are other `ulama' who think that rather than

~~offered any voluntary salat so that the obligatory salat may be made up
~~by it. then the rest of his actions will be treated in the same

~~are the rights of allah. the first of them for which one has to render
~~account is salat. in the rights of people, the first to be decided will
~~be blood shed by a person of his fellow being. this hadith also makes

~~to stand in the style of a wall, each brick of which is interlocked with
~~another so much so that there is not even the slightest gap between two
~~of its bricks. when people array themselves for salat, they should keep
~~their feet and shoulders so close with one another on their left and
~~right that there is no gap or space between them. moreover, the front
~~rows should be completed first. one should never take place in the

~~is the first row and the worst is the last; but the best of the woman's
~~row is the last and the worst of their rows is the first.'' [muslim].
~~commentary: islam has strongly condemned the association of men and
~~women and enjoined women to keep away from mixing with men and observe
~~hijab (veil). the merit and demerit of place, in the rows in prayer,
~~mentioned in this hadith is with reference to this background because in
~~the days of the prophet (pbuh) women used to perform salat in the
~~prophet's mosque and their rows were at the end of the gathering. there
~~was no gallery nor a separate section for them. thus, for men the best
~~place for performing salat in congregation is the first row because it
~~is farthest from women. the best place for women in salat in
~~congregation is the last row because it is farthest from men. on the
~~contrary, the last row of men was near the first row of women and for
~~this reason it was regarded as the worst one. every row of the people
~~performing salat is good but due to the reason just mentioned, the first
~~row of men and the last row of women are more meritorious, while the

~~allah be pleased with him) reported: when the messenger of allah (pbuh)
~~perceived a tendency among his companions to stand in the back rows, he
~~said to them, "come forward and be close to me and let those who come
~~after you, follow your lead. if people continue to fall behind (i.e., in
~~acquiring virtues), allah puts them behind.'' [muslim]. commentary: in
~~the context of the chapter, this hadith tells us that the prophet (pbuh)
~~disliked those who occupied a place in the rear rows in salat offered in
~~congregation, and exhorted people to find a place in the front rows for
~~the reason that by virtue of that place they could closely observe his
~~manner of offering salat and emulate him, while people in the rear rows
~~could emulate those who were in front of them. in this connection, he
~~used a sentence which has become very common and can also apply to other
~~matters besides salat. one should not lag behind in the acquisition of
~~knowledge and practice and in matters of merit and honour because those
~~who lag behind in such matters are also pushed back by allah, while
~~those who strive hard to acquire merit and honour are helped by allah
~~and he makes their way convenient. this hadith also stresses the need to
~~stand close to the imam and has an inducement for excelling each other

~~abu mas`ud (may allah be pleased with him) reported: the messenger of
~~allah (pbuh) used to gently pat our shoulders when we were standing in
~~rows at the time of salat and say, "keep (the rows) straight; do not
~~differ from each other lest your hearts should suffer from discord. let
~~those of you who are mature and prudent be nearer to me, and then those
~~who are next to them.'' [muslim]. commentary: "to gently pat our
~~shoulders'' means that he would set their shoulders right to straighten
~~the row. "do not differ from each other'' here means that they should
~~stand shoulder to shoulder and ankle to ankle in a straight line. the
~~reason is that disorder will have a spiritual effect and will create
~~discord. the latter would eventually result in the domination of enmity.
~~thus, we learn from this hadith that the imam should stress on his
~~followers the importance of setting their rows straight; and if his
~~exhortation fails, he should go to them personally and set their lines
~~in order. we also learn from this hadith that men known for wisdom,
~~knowledge and piety should stand in the first row and these should be
~~followed by those who come next to them in these virtues. PageV01P1398

~~reported: when the iqamah had been announced, the messenger of allah
~~(pbuh) turned his face towards us and said: "make your rows straight and
~~stand close together, for i can see you from behind my back.'' [al-
~~bukhari]. commentary: this hadith mentions a miracle of the prophet
~~(pbuh), namely that he could see people standing in the back rows when
~~he was leading the salat in congregation. but it does not mean that he
~~was always capable of doing so, as is being impressed by certain people.
~~the true position is that it was a miracle which happened with the will
~~of allah at the time when the prophet (pbuh) was leading the salat in
~~congregation. it must be borne in mind that a miracle happens with the
~~will of allah only. it is not at all in the power of the prophet (pbuh).
~~had he been capable of working a miracle on his own, he would have shown
~~it at his own pleasure. but no prophet was ever capable of it, nor was
~~the prophet (pbuh) an exception to this rule. the second point that we
~~learn from this hadith is that of setting the rows straight, which, in
~~practical terms, means that those who stand up for offering salat in
~~congregation must stand so close to each other that their shoulders and
~~feet are in touch. the prophet (pbuh) used the word "tarassu" to
~~describe this position which means that they should stand like a brick
~~wall, each unit of which is riveted with the other. this is the meaning
~~which the companions of the prophet (pbuh) understood from it and this
~~is what they actually practised. many people nowadays do not stand in
~~salat shoulder to shoulder and foot to foot. some people dislike this
~~practice. may allah grant guidance to the muslims so that they can offer
~~salat according to the sunnah of the prophet (pbuh). PageV01P1400

~~bin bashir (may allah be pleased with them) said: the messenger of allah
~~(pbuh) directed us to keep our rows as straight as arrows. he continued
~~stressing this until he realized that we had learnt it from him
~~(recognized its significance). one day he came into the mosque and stood
~~up. he was just about to say takbir (allah is greater) when he noticed a
~~man whose chest was projected from the row, so he said, "o slaves of
~~allah, you must straighten your rows or allah will certainly put your
~~faces in opposite directions.'' commentary: this hadith has been
~~mentioned earlier and is repeated here for its being germane to this
~~chapter. "put your faces in opposite directions'' signifies that "allah
~~will create enmity in you'', which will create dissension rather than
~~unity, weakness rather than strength and power, and the muslims will
~~then be overwhelmed with the fear and terror of their enemies. this
~~phrase can also have a literal meaning, that is in consequence of
~~confusion in your ranks, allah will turn your face towards the napes of
~~your necks and distort them. may allah save the muslims from both these
~~punishments. PageV01P1401

~~your brothers, and do not leave gaps for satan. whoever joins up a row,
~~he will be joined to allah (i.e., to the mercy of allah); and whoever
~~cuts off a row, he will be cut off from allah (i.e., from his mercy).''
~~[abu dawud]. commentary: this hadith also tells us about the
~~straightening of rows. here the phrase "be accommodating to your
~~brothers'' means that one must cooperate with him who tries to set the
~~rows in order, and rather than feeling annoyance on his action, one
~~should happily set the rows right according to his instructions. this
~~hadith tells us that leaving gaps in rows amounts to leaving space for
~~satan to get in them. to join rows means that no space should be left
~~between the two persons who stand in a line. similarly, a second row
~~should not be started without completing the first one. to break a row
~~means to leave space in it or start the second row without completing
~~the first."break him and join him" can be the words of prayer as well as
~~imprecation, for what they mean is "may allah join him or break him.''
~~this is a prayer from the prophet (pbuh) for the person who straightens
~~the rows as well as an imprecation for the one who breaks the rows.

~~nearer to one another, and put your necks in line, for by him in whose
~~hands my soul is, i see the satan entering through the opening in the
~~row like al-hadhaf (i.e., a type of small black sheep found in yemen).''
~~[abu dawud]. commentary: this hadith stresses that the rows made for
~~salat should not only be integrated like a solid wall but be set
~~vertically close to each other also. this means that there should not be
~~much space between the two rows. the maximum space allowed for it is
~~three spans. space in excess of this is disapproved and takes away the
~~merit of offering salat in congregation. this formula does not apply to
~~the rows of women because a larger distance between the rows of men and
~~women is more meritorious. (ibn `allan). "put your necks in line'' here
~~means to stand shoulder to shoulder - a point which has already been
~~stressed. viewing satan secretly entering into the space left in the
~~rows can be correct literally as well as technically. in the former
~~case, it is a miracle of the prophet (pbuh) while in the latter it is
~~wahy (revelation). almighty allah informed him that satan enters the
~~rows of the people offering prayers through the spaces left by them in
~~their rows. satan is pleased to see these gaps as they make his task of

~~(pbuh) two rak`ah of optional prayers before zuhr and two after the zuhr
~~(noon prayer), and two after the friday prayer, and two after the
~~maghrib (evening) prayer, and two after the `isha' (night) prayer.''
~~[al-bukhari and muslim]. commentary: there are two kinds of nawafil
~~which are performed before or after the obligatory prayer. firstly, the
~~one which were performed by the prophet (pbuh) more frequently.
~~according to the present hadith, their total comes to ten rak`ah while
~~in other ahadith their total is twelve or fourteen rak`ah. they are
~~called sunnah mu'akkadah or as-sunnan ar-rawatib that is, the rak`ah
~~which are proved from the saying and practice of the prophet (pbuh) and
~~which were performed by him usually. these are said to be compulsory
~~prayers. secondly, such nawafil which were not performed by the prophet
~~(pbuh) regularly. these are called sunnah ghair mu'akkadah and are said
~~to be optional prayers. in any case, nawafil have great importance in
~~creating a special link between the worshipper and allah, and for this
~~reason the believers do not neglect them. but their status in shari`ah
~~is of nawafil the performing of which is rewarding and omission of which
~~is not sinful. one thing that should be borne in mind in respect of as-
~~sunnan ar-rawatib or mu'akkadah is that it is better to perform them at
~~home. this was the usual practice of the prophet (pbuh), and this is
~~what he ordained the muslims. PageV01P1411

~~. رواه مسلم قولها : يسلم بين كل ركعتين هكذا هو في مسلم ومعناه : بعد كل
~~ركعتين 1111. `aishah (may allah be pleased with her) reported: when the
~~prophet (pbuh) finished the `isha prayer, he would perform eleven rak`ah
~~before the fajr prayer, concluding each two rak`ah with taslim (i.e.,
~~saying as-salamu `alaikum) and observing the witr (odd) at the end. when
~~the mu'adhdhin finished proclaiming adhan for the fajr prayer and it was
~~dawn, he would rise and perform two short rak`ah, and then would lie
~~down on his right side till the mu'adhdhin came to (inform) him about
~~iqamah. [muslim]. commentary: this hadith tells us that the prophet
~~(pbuh) was in the habit of lying down on his right side after the two
~~sunnah of fajr prayer. it also mentions his offering of tahajjud prayer,
~~which consists of eleven rak`ah. he would perform this salat in the form
~~of four couplets and one witr. according to some narrations, he would
~~perform four couplets and supplement them with three rak`ah of witr.
~~both these forms are right. this hadith, also proves the validity of one
~~witr. this hadith also tells us that the time for the tahajjud and witr
~~prayer is from `isha' prayer to the daybreak. one can perform tahajjud
~~prayer at any time during this period. but, the best time for it is the
~~third part of the night for the reason that after tahajjud one can,
~~after a while, perform fajr prayer in congregation (jama`ah). the
~~tarawih (optional night prayer) performed in the month of ramadan is
~~this tahajjud prayer which is also termed as qiyam-ul-lail for the sake
~~of convenience and benefit of congregational prayer, it is offered soon
~~after `isha' prayer in the month of ramadan. the right number of rak`ah
~~in the tarawih prayer is eight because the prophet (pbuh) never offered
~~more than eight rak`ah; with three witr in the month of ramadan or
~~otherwise. `aishah's statement to this effect quoted in sahih al-bukhari
~~also supports this fact. in hadith literature, the nawafil of the night
~~have been termed as qiyam-ul-lail for which the word "tahajjud'' has
~~also been used in the qur'an and hadith. the word "tarawih'' does not
~~figure anywhere in hadith. the word "tarawih'' for "qiyam-ul-lail''
~~became popular after the era of the prophet (pbuh) and his companions.
~~thus, that number of tarawih prayer agrees with the sunnah of the
~~prophet (pbuh) which is proved by the actual practice of the prophet
~~(pbuh), that is eight rak`ah and three witr only. it is not in any case
~~twenty rak`ah. authentic ahadith prove this point abundantly.

~~has forgiven all his sins for him and would, as a result, save him from

~~(pbuh) repeated it twice; when repeating it for the third time he added:
~~"he who may so wish.'' [al-bukhari]. commentary: this salat means that
~~the two rak`ah are performed after the adhan of maghrib prayer but
~~before the fard salat. this is elucidated by other ahadith. although
~~this has the position of sunnah ghair mu'akkadah, its importance is
~~evident from the fact that the prophet (pbuh) stressed it three times.
~~usually an order (amr) signifies that the act is "essential" but here
~~the decency embedded in the words "he who may so wish" has turned it to

~~"allah is witr (single, odd) and loves what is witr. so perform witr
~~prayer. o followers of qur'an, observe witr (prayer).'' [at-tirmidhi and
~~abu dawud]. commentary: "witr'' literally means odd number. "allah is
~~witr'' means he is one in attributes and actions and has no equal. witr
~~prayer is also called witr for the reason that it is performed in one,
~~three, five and seven rak`ah. it is not permissible to perform it in an
~~even number, like two, four, six, eight etc. thus, we learn from this
~~hadith that witr is not fard and wajib but sunnah mu'akkadah

~~subhan allah) is an act of charity, and every utterance of his praise
~~(i.e., saying al-hamdu lillah) is an act of charity and every utterance
~~of declaration of his greatness (i.e., saying la ilaha illallah) is an
~~act of charity; and enjoining m`aruf (good) is an act of charity, and
~~forbidding munkar (evil) is an act of charity, and two rak`ah duha
~~prayers which one performs in the forenoon is equal to all this (in
~~reward).'' [muslim]. commentary: "charity is due from every joint bone"
~~means that when a person gets up in the morning, it is obligatory for
~~him to thank allah for having every joint of his intact. therefore, one
~~must praise and glorify allah. since a single invocation of the words
~~mentioned in this hadith is equivalent to one sadaqah, one must say
~~these words for 360 times - a number which equals the number of joints
~~in man's body. moreover, to enjoin someone to do what is good and
~~dissuade somebody from vice constitutes sadaqah. however, if one
~~performs two rak`ah of duha prayer, it will serve for sadaqah for all
~~the joints of the body. thus, this hadith highlights the merits and
~~importance of duha prayer. we also learn from this hadith that sadaqah

~~performed when the sun rises about a lance in the sky while the time for
~~duha prayer occurs when the hoofs of the animals begin to burn and they
~~feel troubled with the heat of the sun. usually the six rak`ah performed
~~after maghrib prayer are called salat-ul-awwabin (prayer of the

~~"if anyone performs ablution properly'' means does it in accordance with
~~the sunnah of the prophet (pbuh), that is to say, one should not exceed
~~the prescribed limits, nor should one use water extravagantly. one
~~should wash every organ of the body involved in "wudu'', at the most for

~~ten-times reward. here sins means minor sins as the major ones are not
~~forgiven without sincere repentance nor are huquq-ul-`ibad i.e., (rights
~~of people) forgiven without compensation. 3.one should listen to the

~~commentary: this hadith stresses the following four points: 1.the need
~~to purify oneself as much as possible on jumu`ah. one must use hair oil
~~and perfume so that others do not feel any irritation on the bad smell
~~which may rise from one's clothes. 2.one is advised to go for salat-ul-

~~reward will be. in fact, the reward for it goes on diminishing in
~~proportion to the delay that he makes in reaching the mosque for this
~~purpose so much so that he who reaches the masjid after the khutbah,
~~will be totally deprived of the benefits which go with it because his
~~name does not figure in the register which shows men of merits. salat-
~~ul-jumu`ah is also attended by angels. this fact shows the eminence for
~~the khutbah of salat-ul-jumu`ah and the salat itself. the ghusl

~~of your days is friday. on that day pray to allah to exalt my mention
~~frequently, for your such supplications are presented to me.'' [abu
~~dawud]. commentary: this hadith brings forth the following three points:
~~1.the auspiciousness of time further enhances the merits of virtuous
~~deeds, as is evident from the stress on reciting more and more
~~salutation on the prophet (pbuh) on friday. 2.on jumu`ah, salutation is
~~presented to the prophet (pbuh). this statement goes to prove that he
~~does not hear salutation of anyone directly, either from near or from
~~far. there is a famous hadith which says that he hears it from near but
~~this is not "sahih'' technically. therefore, the truth of the matter is
~~that he does not hear it directly. it is the angels who convey it to
~~him. 3.the most well-worded is "ibrahimi salutation'' because the
~~prophet (pbuh) himself taught it to his companions. the salutation is:

~~prostrated himself. he remained for a long time in prostration. then he

~~himself (again), and remained for a long time in prostration. then he
~~stood up and raised his hands for a while, after which he prostrated
~~himself for the third time. then he (pbuh) said, "i supplicated my rubb
~~and made intercession for my ummah, and he granted me one-third of them.
~~so i again prostrated myself in gratitude to my rubb. then i raised my
~~head and supplicated my rubb for my ummah, and he granted me another
~~third of them. again i raised my head and supplicated my rubb for my
~~ummah and he granted me the last third of them. so i fell into
~~prostration out of gratitude before my rubb.'' [abu dawud]. commentary:
~~the phrase "i supplicated my rubb and made intercession for my ummah''
~~means that the prophet (pbuh) prayed to allah to pardon his ummah and to
~~admit them to jannah. the interpretation of this hadith is stated to be
~~that ultimately all the muslims will be sent to jannah. they will not
~~abide in hell for ever. some of them will go to jannah after suffering
~~the punishment for their major sins, some through the intercession of
~~the prophet (pbuh), and some by the special grace of allah. this
~~interpretation is no doubt true. this is confirmed by other ahadith and
~~forms the belief of the followers of sunnah of the prophet (pbuh). but
~~the hadith under discussion is not "sahih''. however, sujud-ush-shukr
~~(prostrations for thanksgiving), in support of which imam an-nawawi has
~~reproduced this hadith here, is also proved by other ahadith. to
~~prostrate in gratitude to allah is correct and permissible . the
~~incident of k`ab bin malik is included in sahih bukhari and sahih
~~muslim, which shows that after he came to know that his repentance was
~~accepted, he prostrated to give thanks to allah. according to the
~~shafi`i school of thought, the basic elements of sujud-ush-shukr (or
~~prostrations to express thanks to allah) are: (a) the intention (in the
~~heart), (b) the takbir, (c) prostration and (d) taslim; the hanafi
~~school of thought, however, maintain that it is an act of prostration
~~between two takbir. it is permissible to perform it outside salat, but

~~متفق عليه 1164. `abdullah bin mas`ud (may allah be pleased with him)
~~reported: mention was made before the prophet (pbuh) of a man who slept
~~throughout the night till morning. the messenger of allah (pbuh)
~~remarked, "he is a man in whose ears satan urinated.'' [al-bukhari and
~~muslim].n commentary: this hadith holds inducement for qiyam-ul-lail and
~~highlights its merits. it also urges one to perpetuate his good actions,
~~follow the practice of the righteous and avoid the way of those who are
~~negligent or become negligent in the performance of virtuous deeds.
~~urination of satan in a person's ear or ears can be literally true
~~(although we cannot perceive it) because if a person does not seek the
~~protection of allah against satan, then satan joins him in food and
~~other activities, as is evident from other ahadith. therefore, urination
~~of satan is also possible. some people think it is a metaphor to the
~~effect that he who does not get up at night for prayer and goes on
~~enjoying his sleep, satan `closes' his ears until he does not hear the
~~remembrance of allah. some others consider it a metaphor for the
~~contempt and insult of satan. in either case, we learn from this hadith
~~that missing the qiyam-ul-lail is disliked because it provides satan an
~~opportunity to create mischief, and he succeeds in creating obstructions
~~in the worship and obedience of allah. PageV01P1498

~~عقدة فإن صلى انحلت عقده فأصبح نشيطا طيب النفس وإلا أصبح خبيث النفس كسلان
~~] متفق عليه [ قافية الرأس ] : آخره 1165. abu hurairah (may allah be
~~pleased with him) reported: the messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "when
~~any one of you sleeps, satan ties three knots at the back of his neck.
~~he recites this incantation at every knot: `you have a long night, so
~~sleep.' if he awakes and remembers allah, one knot is loosened. if he
~~performs wudu', the (second) knot is loosened; and if he performs
~~prayer, (all) knots are loosened. he begins his morning in a happy and
~~refreshed mood; otherwise, he gets up in bad spirits and sluggish
~~state.'' [al-bukhari and muslim]. commentary: "tying knots'' can be
~~literal, the way magicians do it in their magical exercises. with this
~~practice satan tries to withhold people from the worship of allah. some
~~people are of the opinion that it is a metaphor for sleepiness/dozing.
~~in any case, satan does his level best to withhold a person from the
~~worship of allah. satan experiences frustration if someone gets up at
~~night for prayer; he also experiences happiness if he manages to keep
~~someone asleep until dawn. PageV01P1499

~~not omit any day of that month. if one wished to see him performing
~~salat during the night, he could do that; and if one wished to see him
~~sleeping at night, he could do that. [al-bukhari]. commentary: what this
~~hadith tells us is that whether it was optional saum (fasting) or
~~optional salat (nawafil) of the night, that is to say qiyam-ul-lail, the
~~prophet (pbuh) did not have a permanent routine for it. sometimes it so
~~happened that almost the month passed but he did not observe fasting and
~~then a few days before the end of the month he would start fasting.
~~sometimes, he would fast day after day continuously, and it would appear
~~as if he would continue fasts for the whole month, but he would then
~~suddenly terminate fasts. similar was the case of tahajjud. sometimes,
~~he would perform tahajjud prayer in the first portion of the night,
~~sometimes in the second, and sometimes in its later portion. thus, he
~~was found sleeping and performing salat in every part of the night.

~~that he used to make long prostrations in tahajjud prayer, because one
~~gets closer to allah in a state of prostration. this hadith also

~~the messenger of allah (pbuh) did not observe more than eleven rak`ah
~~(of tahajjud prayers), be in ramadan or any other month. first of all he
~~would perform four rak`ah. ask not about their excellence and their
~~length. he (pbuh) would then perform four more rak`ah; and do not ask
~~about their excellence and their length. then he would perform three
~~rak`ah (witr prayer). (`aishah (may allah be pleased with her) added) i
~~submitted: "o messenger of allah! do you sleep before performing the
~~witr prayer?'' he (pbuh) said, "o `aishah! my eyes sleep but my heart
~~does not sleep.'' [al-bukhari and muslim]. commentary: 1."my heart does
~~not sleep'' signifies that "usually i am not so overwhelmed by sleep
~~that i miss the salat''. some people give a different interpretation of
~~this by saying that his wudu' remained intact as his heart was awake.
~~this is one of the attributes of the prophet (pbuh). this hadith
~~stresses on performing salat with full decorum and concentration because
~~this is the way the prophet (pbuh) did it. the real beauty of salat lies
~~in performing it in accordance with the sunnah of the prophet (pbuh) and
~~with full peace of mind. 2. if one is confident of getting up in the
~~later part of the night, one can perform witr after tahajjud prayer; but

~~to commit an act of wrong. he was questioned: "what did you intend to
~~do?'' he replied: "i intended to sit down and stop following him (in

~~that: 1. qiyam-ul-lail (tahajjud prayer) must be fairly long and every
~~constituent of it should be performed with full peace of mind. 2. it is
~~permissible to perform nafl salat in congregation. 3. in case an imam
~~inordinately lengthens a salat, it is permissible for his followers to
~~detach themselves from the congregation. but ibn mas`ud has regarded his

~~(may allah be pleased with him) reported: i performed salat with the

~~thought that he would go in ruku` (bowing posture in salat) at the end
~~of one hundred ayat, but he continued (reciting); and i thought that he
~~would perhaps recite (this surah) in the whole rak`ah (prayer), but he
~~continued the recitation; i thought he would perhaps bow on completing
~~(this surah). he (pbuh) then started reciting surat an-nisa' which he
~~followed with surat al-imran. he recited leisurely. when he recited an
~~ayah which mentioned the tasbeeh, he would say subhan allah and when he
~~recited the ayah which tells how the rubb is to be asked, the messenger
~~of allah (pbuh) would then ask from him; and when he (pbuh) recited an
~~ayah asking one to seek protection allah, he would seek protection of
~~allah. then he bowed and said, "subhana rabbiyal-azim (my rubb the great
~~is free from imperfection)''; his bowing lasted about the same length of
~~time as his standing, (and then on returning to the standing posture
~~after ruku`) he would say, "sami' allahu liman hamidah, rabbana lakal-
~~hamd (allah listens to him who praises him. praise be to you, our
~~rubb!),'' and he would then stand about the same length of time as he
~~had spent in bowing. he would then prostrate himself and say, "subhana
~~rabbiyal-a`la (my rubb the supreme is free from imperfection),'' and his
~~prostration lasted nearly the same length of time as his standing
~~(qiyam). [muslim]. commentary: this hadith has already been mentioned.
~~in his commentary on sahih muslim, imam an-nawawi has interpreted the
~~words (occuring in this hadith) as "i thought he would perhaps recite in
~~the whole rak`ah.'' here rak`ah means complete salat (two rak`ah). this
~~interpretation is necessary for the reason that in its absence, the
~~meanings of the next sentence go wrong. due to this reason, we have kept
~~these meanings in view in our translation. in any case, it furnishes
~~justification for the desirability of long qiyam (standing in salat),
~~the desirability of congregation in nafl salat, and the maintenance of
~~the correct sequence in the recitation of the surah of the qur'an in
~~prayers, which is not accepted by many people. PageV01P1509

~~commentary: like the special moment in jumu`ah, the time when this

~~that qiyam during the month of ramadan was the practice of the prophet
~~(pbuh). during the course of a ramadan, he made qiyam for three nights
~~consecutively, that is, he performed this nafl salat in congregation
~~with his companions. on the fourth night, when his companions gathered
~~for this purpose he said to them, "i am afraid it will be made
~~obligatory for you.'' so, in spite of their desire to join him in this
~~prayer, he did not lead the salat that night. how many rak`ah did he
~~perform in congregation in these three nights is a pertinent question
~~here. according to ahadith their total comes to eleven; eight rak`ah and
~~three witr. thus the masnun number of rak`ah of qiyam ramadan is eleven.
~~4. this nafl salat has been interpreted in ahadith as qiyam ramadan.
~~later on they were named tarawih. tarawih is the plural of tarwihah.
~~since the companions of the prophet (pbuh) and the successors to the
~~companions used to make a lengthy qiyam in them and they would take rest
~~after performing every four rak`ah. this is how these came to be named
~~tarawih (rest prayer). (four rak`ah are called tarwihah). 5. tarawih are
~~in fact tahajjud prayers. for the sake of convenience and benefit of the
~~maximum number of people, it is performed in the month of ramadan soon
~~after `isha' prayer, along with the latter, which is the early time for
~~tahajjud prayers. 6. that the tarawih were performed in congregation is
~~established from the conduct of the prophet (pbuh). he led this salat on
~~23rd, 25th and 27th of ramadan. during his caliphate, `umar (may allah
~~be pleased with him) started it again and ordered ubayy bin k`ab and
~~tamim ad-dari to perform them in congregation. he enjoined them to
~~perform eight rak`ah tarawih and three rak`ah witr. this practice has
~~been going on ever since. 7. some people say that performing tarawih in
~~congregation is a bid`ah (innovation in religion) because it was
~~introduced in the reign of `umar (may allah be pleased with him). but
~~this is not correct because it is established that the prophet (pbuh)
~~did not continue it out of fear that it will be made obligatory;
~~otherwise he would have carried on with it. when the fear that this
~~practice be made obligatory was over, `umar (may allah be pleased with
~~him) gave it the form of a nafl prayer and revived the mode of
~~performing it collectively, and thus fulfilled the desire of the prophet
~~(pbuh). in spite of all these facts, it is still permissible for one to
~~perform tarawih individually in the late hours of the night. since
~~ordinary people are not capable of performing it individually, the step
~~taken by `umar (may allah be pleased with him) is perfectly correct. if
~~this had not been done, the majority of the people will have remained
~~deprived of the blessings and reward of qiyam-ul-lail, which would have
~~been a great deprivation indeed. 8. twenty rak`ah tarawih is not
~~confirmed from any authentic hadith, nor its ascription to `umar i(may
~~allah be pleased with him)is proved from any reliable muttasil
~~(connected) hadith. a claim has been made in a munqati` (disconnected)
~~narration that in the days of `umar (may allah be pleased with him)
~~people used to perform twenty, thirty-six and forty rak`ah of tarawih
~~out of which one can at best infer the justification for more than eight
~~rak`ah nafl prayer. even then the masnun tarawih will be eight rak`ah
~~only, and more or less than that will be ghair-masnun. 9. in tarawih,
~~that is qiyam ramadan, lengthy qiyam is masnun, but it must be borne in
~~mind that the qur'an must be recited according to the principles of
~~`ilm-ut-tajwid with clear and distinct voice at a slow pace. many of the
~~qurra recite so fast that it is hard for one to understand, let alone
~~concentrate on what is being recited. such recitation is a means of
~~retribution rather than reward. a new system is now in vogue: according
~~to this fashion, the whole qur'an is finished within a few days and
~~eight to ten parts of it are recited daily in tarawih. there are
~~hundreds of thousands people in the audience. after listening the qur'an
~~for a few days, these people console themselves that they have heard the
~~entire qur'an in tarawih and are now free to pay full attention to their
~~business to make the best of the `eid season. they do not care to know
~~whether the qari is reciting the qur'an or something else. PageV01P1523

~~the beard grow, using miswak (tooth-stick), snuffing up water into the
~~nose (in ablution), paring the nails, washing the bases of the finger
~~joints; plucking the underarm hair, removing of the pubic hair and
~~removing impurities with water from the affected part after a call of
~~nature.'' the subnarrator said: i forgot the tenth but it might possibly
~~be the rinsing of the mouth (in ablution). [muslim]. commentary: this
~~hadith tells us about ten qualities which are natural to human beings.
~~some `ulama' are of the opinion that the tenth quality among them is
~~circumcision. anyway, the importance of these ten qualities and the
~~stress on them are evident. the first thing among them is the trimming
~~of moustache. this is sunnah of the prophet (pbuh) and is meant to cut
~~the projected hair on the upper lip. 2. in the opinion of `ulama',
~~keeping the beard is compulsory but its extent is not determined. on the
~~basis of ibn `umar's practice, some `ulama' hold that the size of
~~handful is essential and beyond that cutting is permissible, or
~~according to a weak narration some consider its trimming towards length
~~and breadth quite fair. but this opinion is not correct. in the words of
~~al-bukhari and muslim, the prophet (pbuh) used five words for it which
~~are (a'fu, aufu, arkhu, arju, waq'iru) and all of them have similar
~~meanings that the beard should be left alone on natural growth. but, for
~~a few exceptional cases, the common injunction in this behalf is that
~~one should keep full beard. one should neither trim it in length and
~~breadth nor make it handful in size. one can, however, bring it to a
~~normal size in case of its wild growth if one fears that it will cause
~~derision and laughter. 3,4. the miswak and the rinsing of mouth, and
~~putting water into the nostrils are necessary for wudu'. "istinshaq''
~~means to draw water with full force in the nostrils as one does for
~~smelling perfume. except during saum, istinshaq is stressed in wudu'. 5.
~~paring of the nails is also necessary for cleanliness. if this is not
~~done, filthy matter will go to the mouth through the nails. the fashion
~~of keeping long nails, similar to beasts and animals, now in vogue in
~~women as well as men is not only against nature but is also a sign of
~~beastliness and ferocity. 6. the washing of the joints of fingers is
~~also necessary for cleanliness. 7,8. the removal of the underarm hair
~~and below the naval is an integral part of cleanliness and inordinate
~~delay in it is disliked. according to a hadith, delay in it beyond forty
~~days is disgusting. 9. cleaning with water after evacuation is a must
~~for purification because one cannot perform salat without it. it is
~~permissible to use clod or toilet tissue, etc., but such things used for
~~this purpose should be odd in number, i.e., 3,5,7. but it is better to
~~follow this with water, as water is a natural cleanser. 10. circumcision
~~is also an old tradition or practice. according to the general opinion
~~of `ulama', it is obligatory. some of them are of the view that it is
~~desirable on the seventh day. it is, however, permissible afterwards.

~~anything from it.'' (upon hearing this) the messenger of allah (pbuh)

~~the following three points: 1. the status of some of the important
~~obligations and voluntary prayers. 2. by mentioning practice with the
~~precepts, it has made the fact evident that the two are inseparable. 3.

~~departure, he instructed him thus: "first of all, call the people to
~~testify `la ilaha illallah' (there is no true god except allah) and that
~~i (muhammad) am the messenger of allah, and if they accept this
~~(declaration of faith), then tell them that allah has enjoined upon them
~~five salat during the day and night; and if they obey you, tell them
~~that allah has made the payment of zakat obligatory upon them. it should
~~be collected from their rich and distributed among their poor.'' [al-
~~bukhari and muslim]. commentary: this hadith has already been mentioned.
~~here it is repeated to emphasize the importance of zakat. we learn from
~~it that zakat is collected from the affluent of the locality and
~~distributed among the poor of that very locality. if there is any
~~surplus, then that alone can be sent to the needy of other areas. in the
~~same spirit, the amount of zakat will be spent on the needy muslims only
~~and not among the non-muslims. alms and charity can, however, be spent
~~on the poor of other communities. this hadith also tells us the wisest
~~course of invitation and preaching. PageV01P1548

# وعن ابن عمر رضي الله عنه قال قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم : [

~~وحسابهم على الله ] متفق عليه 1209. ibn `umar (may allah be pleased with
~~them) reported: the messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "i have been
~~commanded to fight people till they testify `la ilaha illallah' (there
~~is no true god except allah) that muhammad (pbuh) is his slave and
~~messenger, and they establish salat, and pay zakat; and if they do this,
~~their blood (life) and property are secured except when justified by
~~law, and it is for allah to call them to account.'' [al-bukhari and
~~muslim]. commentary: "except when justified by law'' means that after
~~the acceptance of islam, if someone commits a crime which is punishable
~~by hadd this will be certainly imposed on him, or her, i.e., cutting of
~~hand in case of theft, one hundred stripes or stoning to death in case
~~of fornication, capital punishment in retaliation for murdering an
~~innocent person. in this hadith the words "it is for allah to call them
~~to account'' means that if they are not sincere in the acceptance of
~~islam and would put up an appearance of islam like hypocrites, or would
~~commit a crime which is liable for hadd but is somehow not detected by
~~the islamic court or authorities concerned, they will be taken to
~~account for it by allah, that is allah will decide about them on the day
~~of judgement. it is evident from this hadith that so long as kufr is
~~present in this world, it is necessary to wage jihad against it to
~~finish it off, and so long as all the disbelievers do not openly accept
~~islam and adopt the islamic way of life, muslims are duty-bound to make
~~jihad against them. PageV01P1549

~~the messenger of allah (pbuh) passed away, abu bakr (may allah be
~~pleased with him) was appointed as his successor (caliph). amongst the
~~arabs some men apostatised. abu bakr (may allah be pleased with him)

~~they testify la ilaha illallah (there is no true god except allah); and
~~if they do it, their blood (life) and property are secured except when
~~justified by law, and it is for allah to call them to account." upon
~~this abu bakr (may allah be pleased with him) said: "by allah, i would
~~definitely fight him who makes distinction between salat and the zakat,
~~because it is an obligation upon the rich to pay zakat. by allah i will
~~fight them even to secure the piece of rope which they used to give to
~~the messenger of allah (pbuh).'' `umar (may allah be pleased with him)
~~said: "i realized that allah opened the heart of abu bakr (may allah be
~~pleased with him) for fighting those who refused to pay zakat, and i
~~fully recognized that abu bakr ¨(may allah be pleased with him) was
~~right.'' [al-bukhari and muslim]. commentary: this hadith brings into
~~prominence the excellence of abu bakr as-siddiq's determination,
~~religious firmness and deep understanding of the islamic law. it also
~~tells us that one who does not accept that zakat is obligatory in islam,
~~is a kafir like the one who renounces salat. the stand taken by abu bakr
~~was ultimately accepted by all the companions of the prophet (pbuh), and
~~this is how they unanimously agreed to wage jihad against those who
~~refused to pay zakat. this unanimous consent on the issue of zakat was
~~based on the order of shari`ah. PageV01P1550

~~allah (pbuh)) said, "worship allah and never associate anything with him
~~in worship, establish salat, pay zakat, and strengthen the ties of
~~kinship.'' [al-bukhari and muslim]. commentary: this hadith mentions the
~~compassion for relatives along with the salat and saum which are
~~obligatory in islam. it indicates the importance of compassion for
~~relation in islam. the term `strengthen the ties of kinship' implies
~~nice treatment of one's relatives regardless of circumstances,

~~a deed by which i may be entitled to enter jannah.'' the prophet (pbuh)
~~said, "worship allah, and never associate anything with him, establish
~~salat, pay the zakat which has been enjoined upon you, and observe saum
~~of ramadan.'' he (the bedouin) said: "by him in whose hand my soul is, i
~~will never add anything to these (obligations).'' when he turned his
~~back, the prophet (pbuh) said, "he who wants to see a man from the
~~dwellers of jannah, let him look at him (bedouin).'' [al-bukhari and
~~muslim]. commentary: 1. the bedouin mentioned in this hadith was a new
~~muslim and for this reason the prophet (pbuh) told him some essential
~~obligations of islam so that he did not feel over-burdened with
~~exhortation. imam at-tabarani said: "this hadith and its like was
~~addressed to bedouins who were newly -- converted to islam. the prophet
~~(pbuh) told them no more than to fulfill the main obligatory acts of
~~islam so that they would not feel over-burdened, and therefore bored.''
~~following the divine injunctions in a gradual manner is very important.
~~for once the hearts of the newly converted start to open to the
~~understanding of the divine injuctions, they will automatically start
~~practising the optional and voluntary acts of devotion with a view to
~~gain allah's reward and pleasure. 2. there are two categories of people
~~who have been granted jannah. first, those who are called al-`asharah
~~al-mubashsharah. they are ten most distinguished of the prophet's
~~followers whose entrance into jannah was foretold by the prophet (pbuh)
~~himself. second, some other persons who were given glad tidings of
~~jannah by the prophet (pbuh). the bedouin mentioned in this hadith is a
~~case in point. the prophet (pbuh) also declared hasan and hussain, the
~~two sons of `ali (may allah be pleased with them), the chiefs of young-
~~men of jannah and also gave glad tidings of jannah to his wives and his
~~daughter fatimah (may allah be pleased with him). PageV01P1552

~~allegiance to the prophet (pbuh) to establish salat, to pay the zakat
~~and to have the welfare of every muslim at heart. [al-bukhari and
~~muslim]. commentary: this hadith has already been mentioned and has been
~~repeated here for its relevance to this chapter. here the phrase "to
~~pledge allegiance to establish salat'' and "to pay the zakat'' means
~~acceptance of islam because these are such important articles of islam
~~that one cannot think of islam without them. allegiance to them is, in
~~other words, allegiance to islam. it is a pledge which was taken by the
~~prophet (pbuh) from everyone who embraced islam. he would also take a
~~pledge for jihad when there was a need for it. the third pledge is
~~pledge of khalifah which was taken by khulafa ar-rashidun (the rightly-
~~guided caliphs) and subsequently the muslim rulers. these are the three
~~pledges which are proved from the rightly-guided muslims. the oath

~~slaves, and he will be shown his final abode, either to jannah or to

~~pay what is due on him (i.e., their zakat)?'' he (pbuh) replied, "in the
~~same way the owner of camels who does not discharge what is due in
~~respect of them (their due includes their milking on the day when they
~~are taken to water) will be thrown on his face or on his back in a vast
~~desert plain on the day of resurrection and they will trample upon him
~~with their hoofs and bite him with their teeth. as often as the first of
~~them passes him, the last of them will be made to return during a day
~~the measure whereof will be fifty thousand years, until judgement is
~~pronounced among (allah's) slaves, he will be shown his final abode

~~who possesses cattle and sheep and does not pay what is due on them
~~(i.e., their zakat); on the day of resurrection, he will be thrown on
~~his face in a vast plain desert. he will find none of the animals
~~missing with twisted horns, without horns or with a broken horn, and

~~was asked: "o messenger of allah, what about the horses?'' upon this he
~~(pbuh) said, "the horses are of three types. one, which is a burden for
~~the owner; another which is a shield, and another one which makes its
~~owner entitled to reward. the one for whom these are a burden is the
~~person who rears them for show or for pride or for causing injury to the
~~sentiments of the muslims. they will be a cause of torment for their
~~owners. the one for whom these are a shield is the person who rears them
~~for the sake of allah but does not forget the right of allah concerning
~~their backs and their necks (i.e., he lets a needy ride on them), and so
~~they are a shield for him. those which bring reward to the one who rears
~~them in pastures and gardens are the ones that are used in the cause of
~~allah (jihad) by the muslims. whatever they eat from the meadows and the
~~gardens will be recorded on his behalf as good deeds so much so that
~~their droppings and urine will be counted for an equal number of good
~~deeds for him. even when they break their tying rope and every height
~~from which they climb and every hoofprint which they leave will be
~~counted as a good deed on behalf of the owner. when their owner leads
~~them through a stream from which they drink, though he does not intend
~~to quench their thirst, yet allah would record for him the quantity (of
~~water) of what they would drink on his behalf as good deeds.'' it was
~~asked: "o messenger of allah, what about the donkeys?'' upon this he
~~(pbuh) said, "nothing has been revealed to me in regard to the donkeys
~~in particular except this one verse of a comprehensive nature: "so
~~whosoever does good equal to the weight of an atom (or a small ant)
~~shall see it. and whosoever does evil equal to the weight of an atom (or
~~a small ant) shall see it.''' (99: 8,9). [al-bukhari and muslim].
~~commentary: this hadith tells us that those people who do not pay zakat
~~on their property will be punished with this same property which will
~~become an anguish for them on the day of resurrection. the phrase "and
~~he will be shown his final abode, either to jannah or to hell'' clearly
~~means that this would happen on the day of judgement and the punishment
~~to defaulters would be given before one's entry into jannah or hell. if
~~almighty allah will consider this punishment sufficient for a muslim, he
~~will send him to jannah, otherwise he will consign him to hell. in case
~~he is a muslim, he will be ultimately sent to jannah (after suffering
~~the punishment in hell) otherwise, he will be sent to hell, where he
~~will live for ever. the phrase "as often as the first of them passes
~~him, the last of them will be made to return'' means that the process
~~will be repeated again and again. some people say that there is some
~~alteration in the wording of this hadith. according to them the correct
~~wording is: "when the first camel will have passed, the last in the line
~~will be returned on him''. this wording makes the text more orderly and
~~evident and this is how it occurs in some of the narrations. allah knows
~~the truth. in this hadith the words "fi sabilillah'', (for the sake of
~~allah, or in the cause of allah) have been repeated twice in connection
~~with horses. in the first instance these words are used for noble
~~intention. that is to fulfill humanly needs with it so that one does not
~~have to beg them from others. in the second instance these words stand
~~for jihad. that is one breeds horses to make use of them in jihad. the
~~breeding of horses with this intention is eligible to reward, while in
~~the former case is a means of covering one's poverty. PageV01P1554

~~for it.' fasting is a shield. when anyone of you is observing fast, he
~~should neither indulge in obscene language nor should he raise his
~~voice; and if anyone reviles him or tries to quarrel with him, he should
~~say: `i am fasting.' by him in whose hand the soul of muhammad is, the
~~breath of one observing saum is sweeter to allah than the fragrance of
~~musk. the one who fasts, experiences two joys: he feels pleasure when he
~~breaks the fast. he is joyful by virtue of his fast when he meets his
~~rubb.'' [al-bukhari and muslim]. in a narration by al-bukhari, the
~~messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "allah says: `(the person observing
~~saum) has abstained from food and drink, and sexual pleasures for my
~~sake; fasting is for me, and i will bestow its reward. every good deed
~~has ten times its reward'.'' in a narration by muslim, the messenger of

~~multiplied from ten to seven hundred times. allah (swt) says: `the
~~reward of observing saum is different from the reward of other good
~~deeds; saum is for me, and i alone will give its reward. the person
~~observing saum abstains from food and drink only for my sake.' the
~~fasting person has two joyous occasions, one at the time of breaking his
~~fast, and the other at the time of meeting his rubb. surely, the breath
~~of one observing saum is better smelling to allah than the fragrance of
~~musk.'' commentary: "khuluf'', is the smell that comes from the mouth of
~~person who observes saum. it results from the thirst and hunger which he
~~has to suffer during the saum. the hadith not only tells us the merits
~~of saum but also brings into focus the true significance of it. saum is
~~not thus mere abstention from food, drink and sexual intercourse, but
~~also keeping away from all evils and vices and embracing virtues.

~~1221. abu hurairah (may allah be pleased with him) reported: the
~~messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "observe saum (fast) on sighting the
~~crescent and terminate it on sighting it (the new moon), but if the sky
~~is cloudy before you, then complete the number (thirty days) of the
~~month.'' [al-bukhari and muslim]. commentary: the words "ghabiya'', and
~~"ghumma'', both have the same meanings, namely clouded sky or sky
~~overcast with clouds, as a result of which the moon is not visible. in
~~that case, the injunction is that thirty days of the month be completed.
~~if the moon of ramadan is not sighted on the 29th sha`ban, then its
~~thirty days be completed and ramadan's saum be started on the next day.
~~similarly, if the moon for the month of shawwal is not sighted on the
~~29th of ramadan, thirty days of saum must be completed before
~~celebrating `eid-ul-fitr. this means that the sighting of the moon is
~~necessary for keeping the saum of ramadan. counting by celestial system
~~is not sufficient for this purpose. moreover, the evidence of reliable
~~witnesses for the crescent of ramadan and the evidence of two dependable
~~witnesses for the crescent of shawwal are sufficient. this amount of
~~evidence will fulfill the requirement of sighting the moon. whether the
~~sighting of the moon at one place is sufficient for another place is
~~controversial and arguments of both the groups of `ulama', who support
~~and oppose it, are based on this hadith. the group which contend that
~~the sighting of the moon at one place is valid for another holds that
~~the words "sumu" and "aftiru" are addressed to all the muslims, and for
~~this reason the sighting at one place holds good for another place. the
~~group which holds that the sighting of the moon at one place is not
~~enough for the muslims of other localities contend that the words are
~~addressed to the people who have actually sighted the moon. the muslims
~~of the localities of other areas who have not sighted the moon are not
~~addressed by these words. they say that the sighting of the moon goes
~~with each area according to which they will decide about starting of
~~saum and celebrating `eid. there is a third group also, which is of the
~~opinion that for such areas which are in close proximity and do not have
~~much difference in the timings of sunrise and sunset, the sighting of
~~the moon at one place holds good for the other. in any case, it is a
~~moderate view, which can be implemented without fear of its being wrong.
~~according to this view, at least in one country the sighting of the moon
~~at one place holds good for all other areas. PageV01P1563

~~commentary: this hadith induces us to do two good things frequently and

~~generosity so that people get maximum time for worship and reduce their
~~mundane affairs during this month. second, recitation of the qur'an and
~~mudarsah, (reading and hearing the qur'an from one another) as is done
~~by two huffaz in this manner. the reason for the stress on the qur'an is
~~that the qur'an and the month of ramadan are closely linked with each

# عن أبي هريرة رضي الله عنه عن النبي صلى الله عليه و سلم قال : [ إذا
~~نسي أحدكم فأكل أو شرب فليتم صومه فإنما أطعمه الله وسقاه ] متفق عليه
~~1242. abu hurairah (may allah be pleased with him) reported: the prophet
~~(pbuh) said, "if any one of you forgetfully eats or drinks (while
~~observing fasting) he should complete his saum (fasting), for allah has
~~fed him and given him to drink.'' [al-bukhari and muslim]. commentary:
~~this hadith tells us of a kindness and convenience of islam that during
~~the saum if a person inadvertently does any such thing which destroys
~~his saum, i.e., eating, drinking, cohabitation with wife, etc., his saum
~~will remain intact due to forgetfulness, provided one abandons the act
~~as soon as he remembers that he is observing saum . he needs not make
~~any expiation for such a saum. PageV01P1591

# وعن لقيط بن صبرة رضي الله عنه قال قلت : يا رسول الله أخبرني عن الوضوء

~~sabirah (may allah be pleased with him) reported: i requested the
~~messenger of allah (pbuh) to talk to me about ablution. he said,
~~"perform the wudu' well (by washing those parts of the body, such as the
~~face, hands and feet beyond what is required, like washing the hands up
~~to the upper-arm instead of the elbow). cleanse the base of your fingers
~~and sniff water deep into the nose except when you are observing fast.''
~~[abu dawud and at-tirmidhi]. commentary: ordinarily, it is necessary for
~~wudu' that one should pass water through the nose and rinse mouth
~~thoroughly. but when one is observing saum, he has to take care that
~~water does not go down the throat through the nose as this nullifies the
~~saum. PageV01P1592

~~`aishah, and umm salamah (may allah be pleased with them) reported: the
~~messenger of allah (pbuh) would wake during ramadan (fasting) in a state
~~of major impurity without a wet dream, but on account of sexual
~~intercourse and he would take a bath before dawn. [al-bukhari and
~~muslim]. commentary: this hadith sometimes and the one preceding it
~~inform us that when the prophet (pbuh) would awake in the morning and
~~was in need of bath as a result of coition with his wife, he would take
~~sahur in that condition and then take a bath and perform fajr prayer,
~~because purification is essential for salat. this condition of janabah
~~(impurity) occurred without ihtilam (wet dream) and its cause was coitus
~~with his wife because, according to a well-known saying, ihtilam is the
~~result of satan's suggestions from which prophets are safe. PageV01P1594

# عن أبي هريرة رضي الله عنه قال قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم : [
~~أفضل الصيام بعد رمضان شهر الله المحرم وأفضل الصلاة بعد الفريضة صلاة
~~الليل ] رواه مسلم 1246. abu hurairah (may allah be pleased with him)
~~reported: the messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "the best month for
~~observing saum (fasting) next after ramadan is the month of allah, the
~~muharram; and the best salat (prayer) next after the prescribed salat is
~~salat at night (tahajjud prayers).'' [muslim]. commentary: reference of
~~the month to allah is a sign of its distinction and auspiciousness like
~~baitullah, naqatullah etc. muharram is one of the sacred months and it
~~is this month with which the islamic year starts. the other three sacred
~~months are rajab, dhul-qa`dah, and dhul-hijjah. the hadith points out
~~that fasting in the month of muharram is better than any other month of
~~the year after ramadan. PageV01P1596

~~من شهر أكثر من شعبان فإنه كان يصوم شعبان كله وفي رواية : كان يصوم شعبان
~~إلا قليلا . متفق عليه 1247. `aishah (may allah be pleased with her)
~~reported: the prophet (pbuh) did not observe voluntary saum (fasting) so
~~frequently during any other month as he did during sha`ban. he observed
~~saum throughout the month of sha`ban. another narration is: he (pbuh)
~~observed saum during the whole month of sha`ban except a few days. [al-
~~bukhari and muslim]. commentary: we learn from another hadith the reason
~~why the prophet (pbuh) kept greater number of saum in the month of
~~sha`ban. he did so because deeds are presented before allah during this
~~month. for this reason, he liked that when his deeds were presented, he
~~should be observing saum (nasa'i on the authority of usamah (may allah
~~be pleased with him). in spite of this distinction of sha`ban, muslims
~~have been ordered to observe saum in the first fortnight only, and not
~~in the second in order to maintain their energy and vitality for the
~~obligatory saum (i.e., ramadan). the prophet (pbuh) had greater
~~spiritual strength and saum did not cause him weakness due to this
~~strength. again, by virtue of this strength he would sometimes even
~~observe saum which is termed "saum-al-wisal'' (observing saum continuous
~~without a break in the evening). but he has forbidden his followers from
~~such saum. PageV01P1597

~~رواه أبو داود و [ شهر الصبر ] : رمضان 1248. reported mujibah al-
~~bahiliyah on the authority of her father or uncle that he visited the
~~messenger of allah (pbuh) once and then went to see him again after a
~~year. his appearance had totally changed. he asked the messenger of
~~allah (pbuh) if he had recognized him. the messenger of allah (pbuh)
~~asked, "who are you?'' he replied: "i am al-bahili who visited you last
~~year.'' the messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "you were quite handsome,
~~what has changed your appearance so much?'' he replied, "since my
~~departure from here, i have not eaten anything except at night.'' the
~~messenger of allah (pbuh) remarked, "you have put yourself to torture.
~~observe saum (fasting) during the month of patience (i.e., ramadan) and
~~fast one day from each month.'' he submitted, "permit me to observe more
~~voluntary fasts because i have capacity to do so.'' the messenger of
~~allah (pbuh) said, "then observe fasts for two days in every month.'' he
~~said, "permit me to observe more.'' the messenger of allah (pbuh) said,
~~"observe fasts on three days in every month.'' he requested that he
~~should be allowed to observe more fasts. the messenger of allah (pbuh)
~~said, "fast three days during the sacred months and omit fasting for
~~three days alternately.'' he (pbuh) joined his three fingers together
~~and left them apart while repeating this sentence thrice. [abu dawud].
~~commentary: the name of mujibah bahiliyah's father was abdullah bin
~~harith al-bahli, and if this incident relates to his uncle, his name is
~~not well-known. in any case, he used to take meal at night only, that
~~is, he used to observe saum daily. because of this routine, his health
~~was greatly affected and the prophet (pbuh) prohibited him from
~~observing saum daily and stressed that he should keep saum thrice a
~~month only, especially in the sacred months. with the formula of ten-
~~fold reward, he could thus get reward of thirty days saum in a month.
~~this is how he would be reckoned as one who observes saum throughout the
~~year. people with weak health should not observe more than three saum in
~~a month. those who are healthy, are allowed to observe more saum, but it
~~will be well if they do so in the style of prophet dawud, that is, on
~~alternate days. PageV01P1598

# عن ابن عباس رضي الله عنهما قال قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم : [

~~البخاري 1249. ibn `abbas (may allah be pleased with them) reported: the
~~messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "there are no days during which the
~~righteous action is so pleasing to allah than these days (i.e., the
~~first ten days of dhul-hijjah).'' he was asked: "o messenger of allah,
~~not even jihad in the cause of allah?'' he (pbuh) replied, "not even
~~jihad in the cause of allah, except in case one goes forth with his life
~~and his property and does not return with either of it.'' [al-bukhari].
~~commentary: this hadith brings out the following two points: 1.
~~righteous deeds during the first ten days of the month of dhul-hijjah
~~are far better and more rewarding than righteous deeds done on other
~~days of the year, because they are hajj days in the sacred season of
~~pilgrimage. because of their excellence and importance, allah (swt)
~~swore by them, thus: "by the dawn; by the ten nights...'' (89:1,2) 2.

# عن أبي قتادة رضي الله عنه قال : سئل رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم عن
~~صوم يوم عرفة ؟ قال : [ يكفر السنة الماضية والباقية ] رواه مسلم 1250. abu
~~qatadah (may allah be pleased with him) reported: the messenger of allah
~~(pbuh) was asked about the observance of saum (fasting) on the day of
~~`arafah. he said, "it is an expiation for the sins of the preceding year
~~and the current year.'' [muslim]. commentary: the ninth day of dhul-
~~hijjah is called yaum-`arafah . on this day, pilgrims stop and stand in
~~prayers at `arafat which is the most important ritual of hajj, so much
~~so that hajj is deemed incomplete without it. on that day, the pilgrims
~~are engaged in the remembrance of allah and prayers as that is their
~~most important worship on that day. for this reason, saum is not
~~desirable for them, but for other people, saum has a special merit. the
~~importance and merit of this saum can be judged from the fact that it
~~expiates sins for two consecutive years: the previous year and the
~~current year. but these sins relate only to the minor sins, not the
~~major ones, or become a means of elevation of one's status. PageV01P1602

# وعن ابن عباس رضي الله عنه أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم صام يوم
~~عاشوراء وأمر بصيامه . متفق عليه 1251. ibn `abbas (may allah be pleased
~~with them) reported: the messenger of allah (pbuh) observed saum
~~(fasting) on the day of `ashura' and commanded us to fast on this day.
~~[al-bukhari and muslim]. commentary: `ashura' 10th of muharram. in
~~another hadith, it is stated that when the prophet (pbuh) emigrated from
~~makkah to al-madinah, he saw that the jews were fasting on this day. he
~~asked them why they did this on that day, and they told him that they
~~did it for the reason that allah granted prophet musa emancipation from
~~pharaoh on this day, and so they observed saum in token of their joy. on
~~this, he (pbuh) said that in this happiness of prophet musa, muslims
~~have a greater right to observe saum than the jews. consequently, he
~~also observed saum on 10th of muharram. then, he said that if he lived
~~the following year, he would observe saum on 9th of muharram also so
~~that they would make themselves different from the jews. according to
~~another hadith, he (pbuh) ordained the muslims to observe saum on
~~`ashura' and in addition one more saum on 9th or 11th of muharram in
~~opposition to the jews. (musnad ahmad, vol.4, p-21, edited by ahmad
~~shakir; and mujamma` az-zawaid, vol.3, p-188). thus observance of two
~~saum on this occasion is a sunnah of the prophet (pbuh). these two saum
~~can be observed either on 9th and 10th or 10th and 11th of muharram. it
~~is regrettable indeed that present-day muslims do not follow this sunnah
~~of the prophet (pbuh) and instead observe the baseless practices of
~~mourning assemblies (majalis), which is a grave sin practised by shi`ah.

~~ayyub (may allah be pleased with him) reported: the messenger of allah
~~(pbuh) said, "he who observes as-saum (the fasts) in the month of
~~ramadan, and also observes as-saum for six days in the month of shawwal,
~~it is as if he has observed as-saum for the whole year.'' [muslim].
~~commentary: according to the formula that there is at least ten-fold
~~reward for every virtue, the saum of one month (ramadan) are equivalent
~~to saum of ten months. if one also observes six days of saum of shawwal,
~~they will be equal to saum of two months. thus, one becomes eligible for
~~the reward of one full years' saum. he who makes it a permanent feature
~~is like one who observes saum throughout his life. he will be considered
~~by allah as one who observes saum permanently. although voluntary in
~~nature, they are highly important. one can observe these six-day saum at
~~a stretch or with intervals, but their observance one after the other at
~~the beginning of the month is better. similarly, if a person has missed
~~some saum of ramadan due to illness, travelling etc., he should first
~~make up the shortfall and then observe the voluntary six-day saum of
~~shawwal. PageV01P1607

~~what it denotes is "may allah give you the reward of one who arranges
~~for the iftar (breaking the saum) of somebody." thus, it induces one to

~~hurairah (may allah be pleased with him) reported: the messenger of
~~allah (pbuh) delivered a khutbah and said, "o people! hajj (pilgrimage
~~to the house of allah) has been made incumbent upon you, so perform
~~hajj.'' a man inquired: "o messenger of allah, is it prescribed every
~~year?'' he (pbuh) remained silent till the man repeated it thrice. then
~~he (pbuh) said, "had i replied in the affirmative, it would have surely
~~become obligatory, and you would not have been able to fulfill it.''

~~their frequent questioning and their disagreement with their prophets.
~~so when i order you to do something, do it as far as you can; and when i
~~forbid you from doing anything, eschew it.'' [muslim]. commentary: this
~~hadith brings out the following points: 1. hajj is compulsory once in a
~~lifetime for those who have the means for it. 2. unnecessary questioning
~~is disliked. 3. those who believe in allah and his prophet (pbuh) are

~~allah.'' then he was asked, "what is after that?'' he (pbuh) replied,
~~"hajj mabrur (an accepted pilgrimage).'' [al-bukhari and muslim].
~~commentary: this hadith points out the fact that hajj is one of the most
~~prominent religious acts, provided it is done sincerely and keeping
~~oneself away from sins. some people have interpreted the word "hajj
~~mabrur'' as an accepted hajj. they say that the sign of an accepted hajj
~~is that one becomes a true worshipper of allah, which he was previously
~~not. PageV01P1635

~~حج فلم يرفث ولم يفسق رجع كيوم ولدته أمه ] متفق عليه 1274. abu hurairah
~~(may allah be pleased with him) reported: the messenger of allah (pbuh)
~~said, "whoever performs hajj (pilgrimage) and does not have sexual
~~relations (with his wife), nor commits sin, nor disputes unjustly
~~(during hajj), then he returns from hajj as pure and free from sins as
~~on the day on which his mother gave birth to him.'' [al-bukhari and
~~muslim]. commentary: the true meanings of "rafath'' sexual intercourse
~~but it also signifies obscene and frivolous talk and the expression of
~~sexual desire to one's wife. since coition with one's wife is forbidden
~~during hajj, so conversation with her on this subject or talking for
~~amusement is also disliked. "fisq'' means disobedience of allah and
~~quarrelling with people. one must avoid both of them during hajj. the
~~hajj which is performed with all these restrictions, has the merit that
~~one is totally purged of sins. but this purification is from sins which
~~come in the category of minor sins and which relate to the rights of
~~allah. major sins relating to the rights of allah and lapses in respect
~~of the rights of people are not pardoned without sincere repentance and
~~compensation to the aggrieved. PageV01P1636

~~1275. abu hurairah (may allah be pleased with him) reported: the
~~messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "(the performance of) `umrah is an
~~expiation for the sins committed between it and the previous `umrah; and
~~the reward of hajj mabrur (i.e., one accepted) is nothing but jannah.''
~~[al-bukhari and muslim]. commentary: this hadith tells us that the merit
~~of `umrah is that it is an expiation for sins. but this, too, is an
~~expiation for minor sins. `umrah includes assuming ihram,
~~circumambulation of ka`bah, going between as-safa and al-marwah and halq
~~or taqsir (shaving of head or cutting hair). whether or not `umrah is an
~~obligation like hajj is arguable among the `ulama'. some people, like
~~imam as-shafi`i, hold that it is obligatory; others like the followers
~~of the hanafi school of thought regard it sunnah mu`akkadah; still
~~others think it to be voluntary. imam al-bukhari is inclined to the
~~first view which is also endorsed by sayings of some companions of the
~~prophet (pbuh) about which some muhaddithun (scholars of hadith) have
~~even claimed that these sayings are mausul, the chain of narrators
~~reaches up to the prophet (pbuh). (for further details, please see fath
~~al-bari.) otherwise, the view that it is non-obligatory is preferable.

~~`aishah (may allah be pleased with her) reported: i said: "o messenger
~~of allah! we consider jihad as the best deed, should we not then go for
~~jihad?'' the messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "the best jihad for you
~~women is hajj mabrur (i.e., one accepted by allah).'' [al-bukhari].
~~commentary: in ordinary circumstances, hajj is the best of jihad for
~~women because in islam, politics, economy, government, military affairs
~~etc., come in the purview of men and men alone. women are exempted from
~~all such matters. however, in case of war, if the need arises, women can
~~be engaged for supply of food, first-aid of the wounded etc., on the
~~internal front, provided they can do such works without crossing the
~~bounds of the islamic-type veil. but imparting military training to
~~women and dispatching them to war front are sheer imitations of the
~~western nations for which there is no scope in the teachings of islam.

~~of) `umrah during ramadan is equal to hajj (pilgrimage).'' or said,
~~"equal to the performance of hajj with me.'' [al-bukhari and muslim].
~~commentary: "equal to the performance of hajj'' means the return and
~~reward to which hajj is eligible. it does not mean that it will serve as
~~a substitute for hajj and absolve one from the need to perform it. this
~~distinction of `umrah in the month of ramadan is perhaps for the reason,
~~that in this way two acts of worship are combined at one time.

~~"allah's obligation upon his slaves has become obligatory on my father
~~in his old age. my father is very old and incapable of riding. may i
~~perform hajj on his behalf?'' he (pbuh) said, "yes.'' [al-bukhari and
~~muslim]. commentary: "hajj has become obligatory in old age'' means that
~~when allah has made hajj obligatory, at that time, her father had
~~attained old age, or he came to possess the means in his old age which
~~made him liable for hajj, but he is not capable of undertaking the
~~journey because of his poor health. in such cases, the prophet (pbuh)
~~has granted them permission for hajj by representation. but we learn
~~from other ahadith that hajj by representation can only be done through
~~such a person who has already performed hajj. similarly, if a person of
~~means dies without performing hajj, it is essential that hajj is
~~performed on his behalf; otherwise, he will be answerable for this
~~omission. this formula does not apply to parents who have died in
~~poverty because they were not liable for it. if someone does it for the
~~sake of reward, he will be hopefully granted the reward of voluntary
~~hajj. PageV01P1641

~~old when i was taken to perform hajj (pilgrimage). this was during the
~~time the messenger of allah (pbuh) performed the hajjat-ul-wada`

~~the fact that it is permissible to take children to hajj. the reward of
~~their hajj will be given to their parents. but when after attaining
~~maturity the child becomes liable for hajj, it will be necessary for him
~~to perform it again because the one he has performed in childhood, will

~~unsaddled camel which also carried his provisions (i.e., his zamilah).
~~[al-bukhari]. commentary: "zamilah'' is a mount like a horse, mule etc.,
~~on which luggage is loaded while travelling. what it means here is that
~~the prophet (pbuh) travelled for hajj on such a mount on which he kept
~~his provision for the journey also. in other words, it was his zamilah
~~as well. this incident happened during hajjat-ul-wada` (farewell

~~the companions of the prophet (pbuh) considered trade and commerce
~~during the months of hajj as sinful because they thought that trade had
~~a sort of resemblance with the bazaars which were arranged on the
~~occasion of hajj in the pre-islamic period. through the ayah quoted in
~~this hadith, almighty allah removed their misunderstanding. therefore,
~~trade and commerce on this occasion do not violate the hajj and `umrah.

# وعن أنس رضي الله عنه أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم قال : [ لغدوة
~~في سبيل الله أو روحة خير من الدنيا وما فيها ] متفق عليه 1288. anas (may
~~allah be pleased with him) reported: the messenger of allah (pbuh) said,
~~"verily! setting out in the early morning or in the evening in order to
~~fight in allah's way is better than the world and what it contains.''
~~[al-bukhari and muslim]. commentary: the hadith points out the
~~superiority of fighting in the way of allah. the moment one fights for
~~allah's sake, be it in the early morning or the evening, is better than
~~the world and all that is in it. the reason is that the world as well as
~~what it possesses is transitory while the hereafter is everlasting and
~~eternal. can anything that is temporary be a match for what is eternal?

~~allah) for a single day is far better than the world and all that it
~~contains. a place in jannah as small as the whip of your horse is far
~~better than the world and all that it contains. an endeavour (fighting)

~~[ رباط يوم وليلة خير من صيام شهر وقيامه وإن مات فيه جري عليه عمله الذي
~~كان يعمل وأجري عليه رزقه وأمن الفتان ] رواه مسلم 1291. salman (may allah
~~be pleased with him) reported: i heard the messenger of allah (pbuh) as
~~saying, "observing ribat in the way of allah for a day and a night is
~~far better than observing saum (fasting) for a whole month and standing
~~in salat (prayer) in all its nights. if a person dies (while performing
~~this duty), he will go on receiving his reward for his meritorious deeds
~~perpetually, and he will be saved from al-fattan.'' [muslim].
~~commentary: good deeds of a muslim who dies or is martyred on the
~~frontier will perpetuate and will be credited to his account till the
~~day of resurrection; and like all other martyrs, sustenance will be
~~provided to him even after his death. as allah says: `think not of those
~~as dead who are killed in the way of allah. nay, they are alive, with
~~their rubb, and they have provision.'' (3:169) "al-fattan'' here means
~~the interrogation in the grave which the two angels munkir and nakir
~~will conduct. some religious scholars said that observing ribat serves
~~the purpose of safeguarding religion and islamic territories, while
~~fastings benefit only the person who performs it. it is a great trial
~~which everyone has to pass through. but one who is a mu'min (righteous
~~muslim) goes through it easily by the grace of allah, and he will answer

~~"allah guarantees that he who goes out to fight in his way believing in
~~him and affirming the truth of his messenger, will either be admitted to
~~jannah or will be brought back to his home (safely) from where he has
~~set out, with whatever reward or share of booty he may have gained. by
~~him in whose hand muhammad's soul is, if a person is wounded in the way
~~of allah, he will come on the day of resurrection with his wound in the
~~same condition as it was on the day when he received it; its colour will
~~be the colour of blood but its smell will be the smell of musk. by him

~~remain behind when i go forth (for jihad). by him in whose hand
~~muhammad's soul is, i love to fight in the way of allah and get killed,
~~to fight again and get killed and to fight again and get killed.''
~~[muslim]. commentary: 1. besides the merit of jihad, this hadith
~~mentions the distinction of that mu'min (righteous muslim) who is
~~wounded on the battlefield. it tells us that he will be so resurrected
~~on the day of resurrection as if he was wounded on that day. blood will
~~be dripping from his body which will be emitting the fragrance of musk.
~~this condition will show the distinction and majesty of the mujahid
~~(warrior in the way of allah) on the day of judgement. 2. it also
~~mentions the kindness and mercy which the prophet (pbuh) cherished for
~~his ummah. 3. it also mentions the prophet's passion for jihad which is
~~evident from the repeated expression of his desire for martyrdom - in
~~fact an endless series of life for performing it again and again for the
~~sake of allah. a similar desire is also made by other martyrs. they pray
~~to allah that they be restored to life so that they can lay down their
~~life again and again for his sake. PageV01P1659

~~long as the time between two consecutive turns of milking a she-camel.
~~he who receives a wound or a bruise in the cause of allah will appear on
~~the day of resurrection as fresh as possible, its colour will be the
~~colour of saffron and its fragrance will be that of musk.'' [at-tirmidhi
~~and abu dawud]. commentary: "fawaq'' is the period that intervenes
~~between two consecutive turns of milking a she-camel. it is a very short
~~interval and is an allusion to a very short period that one may spend in
~~jihad. even jihad for such a short time is so meritorious that his
~~entitlement to jannah is ensured by it, provided the mujahid is sincere
~~in his intention and his past conduct is free from major sins and

~~الله أفضل من صلاته في بيته سبعين عاما ألا تحبون أن يغفر الله لكم ويدخلكم

~~] رواه الترمذي وقال حديث حسن [ الفواق ] : ما بين الحلبتين 1297. abu
~~hurairah (may allah be pleased with him) reported: one of the prophet's
~~companions came upon a valley containing a rivulet of fresh water and
~~was delighted by it. he reflected: `i wish to withdraw from people and
~~settle in this valley; but i won't do so without the permission of the
~~messenger of allah (pbuh).' this was mentioned to the messenger of allah
~~(pbuh) and he said (to the man), "do not do that, for when any of you
~~remains in allah's way, it is better for him than performing salat
~~(prayer) in his house for seventy years. do you not wish that allah
~~should forgive you and admit you to jannah? fight in allah's way, for he
~~who fights in allah's cause as long as the time between two consecutive
~~turns of milking a she-camel, will be surely admitted to jannah.'' [at-
~~tirmidhi]. commentary: this hadith brings out two important points:
~~first, jihad is far superior than voluntary salat. this is perfectly
~~true because the benefit of salat is restricted to the one who performs
~~it while the benefits of jihad reach a vast number of people because it
~~is to safeguard the religion, raise the flag of islam high and safeguard
~~the islamic territories. but it is only possible when there is a general
~~proclamation for jihad and there is such a severe fight that it is not
~~permissible for anyone to stay behind; that is to say, it becomes
~~obligatory. in the ordinary circumstances, when a general proclamation
~~for jihad is not made, the voluntary salat, is the best of all acts of
~~worship. second, the companions of the prophet (pbuh) did not do
~~anything without the permission of the prophet (pbuh). PageV01P1662

~~reported: the messenger of allah (pbuh) was asked: "what other good deed
~~could be an equivalent of jihad in the way of allah?'' he (pbuh)
~~replied, "you do not have the strength to do it.'' (the narrator said:)
~~the question was repeated twice or thrice, but every time he (pbuh)
~~answered, "you do not have the strength to do it.'' then he (pbuh) said,
~~"one who goes out for jihad in the cause of allah is like a person who
~~observes saum (fasting), stands in salat (prayer) constantly, recites
~~the ayat of the qur'an and does not exhibit any lassitude in fasting and
~~prayer until the participant of jihad in the way of allah returns.''
~~[al-bukhari and muslim]. commentary: "alqanit'' signifies one who makes
~~recitation of the ayat of the noble qur'an with the fear of allah and
~~humility, or is submissive and obedient to the commands of allah. the
~~example cited here means that so long a mujahid is engaged in jihad, he
~~is like a person who keeps himself occupied in salat at night and
~~observes saum in the day time. the action of such a person can be equal
~~in reward to the conduct of a mujahid. thus, in special situations jihad
~~is the most meritorious act. a worshipper cannot attain that reward for
~~his worship which a mujahid achieves in jihad. PageV01P1663

~~soiled with dust'' means participation in jihad. that is to say, a
~~person takes part in jihad and yet goes to hell is altogether

~~enter hell until the milk drawn from udder goes back to it. the dust of

~~pay wages to a servant in the way of allah, and to provide a camel in

~~here, the word canopy (tent) stands for a covered canopy tent which can
~~provide a mujahid with shade for peace and comfort, and "pay wages''
~~means to provide a servant who can help and serve him. "fahl'' literally
~~means camel and "taruqah'' is that young she-camel which can bear
~~offspring, that is a young healthy she-camel which can be of service to
~~the mujahid. what all this means is that such work is highly meritorious

~~[muslim]. commentary: this hadith also stresses the fact that if a
~~person is unable to take part in jihad due to illness, for example, he
~~should then provide such material to a mujahid which is helpful for him
~~in jihad. if he does so, he will be eligible to the same reward which is
~~due on jihad. this would also be a source of increase and growth in his
~~possessions. on the basis of this argument it has been stated that one
~~should always intend to expend his possession on something noble. he who
~~does not get the opportunity to expend it on what he had intended should

~~and added: "whoever stays behind (and looks well after the family and
~~the property of those who have joined the expedition) will get half the
~~reward of the warrior.'' commentary: "the reward will be shared amongst
~~them equally'' or "will get half the reward'' signifies one and the same
~~thing. some people might mistakenly think that these two narrations of
~~sahih muslim apparently contradict each other because they imply that he
~~who takes part in jihad and he who provides material to a mujahid or
~~looks after the family of a mujahid in his absence from home would get
~~equal reward. for this reason, some people have taken the word "half''
~~as superfluous thinking that some narrator has added it in the text on
~~his own. but al-hafiz ibn hajar is of the opinion that after the
~~acceptance of the credibility of this hadith and the proofs furnished in
~~this regard, it is unfair to ascribe addition of any word to the
~~narrator. its correct interpretation seems to be that when the total
~~reward of it will be evenly distributed between the two, each of them
~~will get the same amount of reward. hence there is no contradiction in
~~these two ahadith. this hadith also tells us that jihad is not an
~~express obligation; and if one of the two persons takes part in jihad,
~~it will suffice for the other also. what can be inferred from this is
~~that the others should take part in jihad in such a manner that those
~~who have wealth, should arrange for the military requirements of the
~~mujahidun and look after their families, and in case any mujahid is
~~martyred, they should provide financial help to his family if it does
~~not have sufficient means for a respectable living. similarly, people in
~~other walks of life should also take part in jihad in every possible
~~manner. PageV01P1674

~~الله صلى الله عليه و سلم : [ نعم إن قتلت في سبيل الله وأنت صابر محتسب

~~(with all his attributes) are the most meritorious of actions.'' a man
~~stood up and said: "o messenger of allah! inform me if i am killed in

~~(pbuh) said, "yes, in case you are killed in the way of allah and you
~~remained patient, hopeful of reward, and advancing forward without
~~retracing back (i.e., while fighting).'' then he said, "what was your
~~question?'' he inquired again: "inform me, if i am killed in the way of

~~replied, "if you remained patient, hopeful of reward and always fought
~~without turning your back upon enemy, everything, except debt, will be

~~tells us about the great merit and reward of martyrdom that it makes up
~~for the shortcomings of the martyrs. this is, however, subject to four
~~conditions which have been mentioned in the hadith. the rights of
~~people, such as debt, will not be forgiven. similarly, major sins will
~~not be pardoned without sincere repentance. some scholars are of the
~~opinion that debt here means such debt which one does not pay in spite
~~of the fact that he is able to pay it. such debts which a debtor intends
~~to pay but their payment has been delayed due to the lack of means for
~~it and he dies before paying them, will be hopefully forgiven by the
~~grace and mercy of allah. there are other ahadith which lend support to
~~this view. PageV01P1678

~~had with him and then fought with the enemy till he was killed.
~~[muslim]. commentary: this hadith brings out the following three points:
~~1. the importance of the obedience of the leader. soldiers should wait

~~his orders. 2. in order to infuse the true spirit of jihad among the
~~soldiers, they should be told and reminded about the blessings of jannah

~~لقيناك فرضينا عنك ورضيت عنا ] متفق عليه . وهذا لفظ مسلم 1316. anas (may
~~allah be pleased with him) reported: some people came to the prophet
~~(pbuh) and said to him: "send with us some men who may teach us the
~~qur'an and the sunnah.'' he (pbuh) sent seventy men from the ansar. they
~~were called al-qurra` (the reciters) and among them was my maternal
~~uncle, haram. they used to recite the qur'an, ponder over its meaning
~~and learn (its wisdom) at night. in the day, they used to bring water
~~and pour it in pitchers in the mosque, then they would collect wood and
~~sell it; and with the sale proceeds, they would buy food for the people
~~of as-suffah and the needy. the prophet (pbuh) sent the reciters with
~~these people but these (treacherous people) fell upon them and killed
~~them before they reached their destination. (while dying) they
~~supplicated: "o allah convey from us the news to our prophet that we
~~have met you (in a way), that we are pleased with you and you are
~~pleased with us.'' (the narrator said:) a man attacked haram from behind
~~and smote him with a spear which pierced him. whereupon haram said: "by
~~the rubb of ka`bah, i have met with success. the messenger of allah

~~were saying: "o allah! convey from us to our prophet the news that we
~~have met you (in a way) that we are pleased with you and you are pleased
~~with us.'' [al-bukhari and muslim]. commentary: this hadith mentions the
~~following three points: 1. through conspiracy infidels took with them
~~seventy ansari companions of the prophet (pbuh) , who were distinguished
~~for studying and teaching the noble qur'an, and martyred them in their
~~region. this tragic incident goes to prove that the prophet (pbuh) did
~~not have the knowledge of the unseen. had he possessed this knowledge,
~~he would not have sent his companions with the infidels. when the
~~companions of the prophet (pbuh) realized that they were trapped and
~~there was no chance of their survival, they prayed to allah to convey
~~their message to the prophet (pbuh). their prayer was answered by allah
~~who conveyed their message by means of wahy (revelation) to the prophet
~~(pbuh). on learning it through wahy, he (pbuh) informed this tragic
~~incident to his companions. 2. "as-suffah'' is a terrace in which people
~~stayed, they had neither any permanent source of income nor any free
~~public kitchen nor was there any arrangement for the supply of their
~~food from individuals. they depended entirely on the grace of allah.
~~every now and then they received some sadaqah or gift and they all
~~shared it. some of them would collect firewood and through its sale,
~~raised some money to purchase food for themselves and their companions.
~~3. the task of invitation to islam and dissemination of its teachings is
~~an arduous one. people who undertake this task have to face bitter
~~criticism from their friends and foes, and one has sometimes to lose
~~one's life in this mission. but this is a mission of the prophets and it
~~should be undertaken by the savants as they are truly worthy of it.

~~fight against the pagans, no doubt, allah will see how (bravely) i will
~~fight.'' on the day of uhud, when the muslims turned their backs and
~~fled, he said, "o allah! i apologize to you for what these (i.e., his
~~companions) have done, and i denounce what these (i.e., the pagans) have
~~done.'' then he advanced and sa`d bin mu'adh met him. he said: "o sa`d
~~bin mu'adh! by the rubb of an-nadr, jannah! i am smelling its aroma
~~coming from before (the mountain of) uhud,'' later on, sa`d said: "o
~~messenger of allah! i cannot achieve or do what he (i.e., anas bin an-
~~nadr) did. we found more than eighty wounds by swords, spears and arrows
~~on his body. we found him dead and his body was mutilated so badly that
~~none except his sister could recognise him by his finger.'' we used to
~~think that the following ayah was revealed concerning him and other men
~~of his sort: "among the believers are men who have been true to their
~~covenant with allah (i.e., they have gone out for jihad, and showed not
~~their backs to the disbelievers), of them some have fulfilled their
~~obligations (i.e., have been martyred).'' (33:23). commentary: this
~~hadith has been mentioned earlier. it was clarified there by imam an-
~~nawawi that the word "layarayann-allahu'' has been mentioned in two
~~forms. the translation given above accords with its first form. in its
~~second form, it means "allah will manifest to the people what i will
~~do''. through these words anas bin nadr expressed, in very cautious
~~words, his determination to fight chivalrously but refrained from making
~~any claim or pretension. here, we have a lesson that if one intends to
~~do a good deed, he should not make any tall claims about it but do it
~~with his utmost effort when it is time to do it. almighty allah will
~~certainly make it manifest to the people. on the contrary, if one does
~~it for name and fame, the deed will go waste because then it will be
~~suffused with hypocrisy rather than sincerity. for further notes please

# وعن ابن عمر رضي الله عنهما أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم قال : [
~~الخيل معقود في نواصيها الخير إلى يوم القيامة ] متفق عليه 1328. ibn `umar
~~(may allah be pleased with them) reported: the messenger of allah (pbuh)
~~said, "there is goodness in the forelocks of horses till the day of
~~resurrection.'' [al-bukhari and muslim] commentary: the "khair'',
~~auspiciousness attributed to horses in the hadith is for those horses
~~which are employed in jihad, because what khair, in fact, signifies is
~~return and reward, but war booty is also included in it. from this
~~angle, the breeding of horses is a highly commendable act. the
~~importance of horses for war in the past, needs no elucidation. even in
~~the present-day world, when the style of war has altogether changed and
~~numerous dangerous weapons have been invented, horses are still playing
~~an important role in the war. PageV01P1693

~~prophet (pbuh) said, "goodness is tied to the foreheads of horses until

~~وبوله في ميزانه يوم القيامة ] رواه البخاري 1330. abu hurairah (may allah

~~who keeps a horse for jihad purposes, having faith in allah and relying
~~on his promise, will find that its fodder, drink, droppings and urine
~~will all be credited to him in his scales on the day of resurrection.''
~~[al-bukhari]. commentary: thus, this hadith performs an inducement for

~~whatever is excreted or discharged by them. PageV01P1695

~~have in return for it on the day of resurrection seven hundred she-
~~camels and every one of them will be wearing a nose-string.'' [muslim].
~~commentary: this hadith mentions the reward which will be given on the
~~day of resurrection on virtues. every virtue will be given at least a
~~ten-fold reward but it will go to the extent of seven hundred times or
~~more. thus, this hadith has glad tidings of a reward of seven hundred

# وعن أبي حماد ويقال : أبو سعاد ويقال أبو أسد ويقال أبو عامر ويقال أبو

~~سمعت رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم وهو على المنبر يقول : [ وأعدوا لهم ما
~~استطعتم من قوة ألا إن القوة الرمي ألا إن القوة الرمي ألا إن القوة الرمي
~~] رواه مسلم 1332. `uqbah bin `amir al-juhani (may allah be pleased with
~~him) reported: i heard the messenger of allah (pbuh) saying from the
~~pulpit, "prepare to meet them (the enemy) with as much strength as you
~~can afford. verily! strength is in archery, strength is in archery,
~~strength is in archery.'' [muslim]. commentary: in accordance with the
~~conditions of his times, the prophet (pbuh) ordained the muslims to
~~acquire every possible power and keep it ready for war. elucidating his
~~order on this point, he stated that by power he meant archery and then
~~he repeated this word three times to stress its importance. he did it
~~because the art of archery had fundamental importance in war at that
~~time. in the present-day world, archery has lost its value as it has
~~been replaced by other inventions like tanks, guns, missiles, atom
~~bombs, etc. similar is the case of devices which are used in air and
~~naval war, and all these military wares have superb importance in modern
~~warfare. in the present-day context, the injunction of the noble qur'an
~~to acquire power means manufacturing and possession of all these
~~devices. it is incumbent on the muslims that they equip themselves with
~~all this material and show no carelessness in this regard. in modern
~~times, muslims have badly neglected this field with the result that non-
~~muslims have more knowledge of modern warfare and by dint of that they
~~are dominating the world and making a claim of their supremacy all over
~~the world. unless muslims pursue the qur'anic injunctions on this score
~~and acquire greater or equal or at least similar measure and style of
~~power, as is possessed by the non-muslims, they will not be able to
~~check the onslaught of their enemies, and to defeat them. it is
~~incumbent upon the muslims to overpower the might and power of the
~~infidels for the glorification of islam. PageV01P1697

~~allah will favour them with special help; and because of this help
~~enemies will not be able to cause any harm to them. but it is essential
~~that they should not slack in acquiring the material resources required

~~allah (pbuh) said, "he who learnt archery and then neglected it, is not
~~from us.'' (or said,) "he has been guilty of disobedience (to messenger
~~of allah).'' [muslim]. commentary: this hadith also stresses the
~~importance of the art of archery to the extent that if a muslim forgets
~~it after learning without a valid reason, he is excluded from the
~~followers of the prophet (pbuh). now this exhortation applies with equal
~~force to modern military weapons, and if the present-day muslims lose
~~their command in handling these weapons, they will be exposed to the
~~consequences of which they have been warned in this hadith, because
~~their training in this field is essential for upholding the word of
~~allah and defending the muslims. if the muslims lose proficiency in it
~~after acquiring it, they will be guilty of neglecting a very important

~~for shooting. so shoot and ride, but i like your shooting (more) than
~~your riding. he who gives up archery after becoming adept in it for lack
~~of interest, neglects a (great) blessing.'' (or said,) "one who does so

~~the importance and merit of preparation for war against the enemy. arrow
~~has been used here as a symbol. in modern times, a muslim who
~~manufactures war weapons with the intention that he will use them for
~~jihad, will get a reward for it along with all those who in some way co-
~~operate with him in manufacturing them. instead of archery and horse-
~~riding, muslims should now get the training of handling modern military
~~weapons and they should beware of forgetting it because if they forget

~~allah (pbuh) said, "he who dies without having fought in the cause of
~~allah or without having thought of doing so, will die with one
~~characteristic of hypocrisy in him.'' [muslim]. commentary: it is a
~~different matter that one may not get a chance to take part in jihad,
~~but it would be a hypocritical attitude if one does not ever think that
~~if an opportunity ever comes in his way, he will certainly go for jihad
~~in the way of allah against the infidels. the reason to that is that, to
~~stay back at home at the time of jihad was a habit of the hypocrites. in
~~the light of this, imam al-qurtubi has stated the principle that if one
~~is not capable of doing some virtuous deeds, he should then make a
~~resolve that whenever he will be capable of it, he will do that deed, so
~~that his intention takes the place of his act. he who neither performs a
~~good deed nor aspires for it, has a hypocritical disposition. this is
~~specially true of a muslim who does not even aspire to take part in

~~"he who dies while defending his property is a martyr; he who dies in
~~defence of his own life is a martyr; and he who dies on defense of his
~~faith is a martyr, he who dies in defence of his family is a martyr.''
~~[abu dawud and at-tirmidhi]. commentary: those ten companions of the
~~prophet (pbuh) whom he gave the glad tidings of entering jannah are
~~known as "al-asharatul-mubashsharuna bil-jannah". they are abu bakr as-

~~prophet (pbuh) also foretold that some other people will enter jannah,
~~but these ten people are called al-asharatul-mubashsharuna bil-jannah

~~my property?'' he replied, "do not hand over it to him.'' the man asked,

~~commentary: we learn from this hadith that in the course of struggling
~~to protect one's life and property, it is quite fair to kill a dacoit,
~~robber or plunderer. such a killing is not deemed a sin. in case he is a
~~muslim, he will go to jannah after suffering the punishment of his
~~attacking a muslim. but if he regards the act of attacking muslims and
~~encroaching upon their property lawful, he will be in hell forever. it
~~should be borne in mind that if a person dies while struggling to
~~protect his life and property, he will be granted the status of a
~~martyr, with the difference that a martyr of this kind will be given
~~bath and funeral prayer because he is a martyr by divine order not by
~~his own will and desire. he who is martyred in jihad at the battlefield
~~is exempted from bath and the funeral prayer. PageV01P1723

~~in his path.'' i then asked, "which slaves are most excellent (to set
~~free)?'' he replied, "those who are held in high esteem by their people
~~and whose value is higher.'' [al-bukhari and muslim]. commentary: it is
~~evident that a slave who is more valuable in the eyes of his master will
~~be difficult to part with, whether he is purchased to set free or
~~liberated on one's own accord. hence, it will be more meritorious to
~~free such a slave than ordinary ones. this conduct furnishes the
~~principle that the reward of sacrificing something for allah goes with
~~its quality. the more precious the thing sacrificed, the greater its
~~reward will be. the qur'an expressly states: "by no means shall you
~~attain al-birr - piety, righteousness - here it means allah's reward,
~~i.e., jannah), unless you spend (in allah's cause) of that which you
~~love.'' (3:92). the institution of slavery is now finished, but its

~~wearing a nice gown, and his slave was also wearing one similar to it. i
~~asked him about it, and he said that he had exchanged harsh words with a
~~person during the lifetime of the messenger of allah (pbuh) and put him
~~to shame by making a reference to his mother. that person came to the
~~messenger of allah (pbuh) and made mention of that to him. thereupon the
~~messenger of allah said, "you are a person who has remnants of the `days
~~of ignorance' in you. your slaves are your brothers. allah has placed
~~them under your authority. he who has his brother under him, should feed
~~him from whatever he eats, and dress him with whatever he wears, and do
~~not burden them (assign burdensome task to them) beyond their capacity;
~~and if you burden them then help them.'' [al-bukhari and muslim].
~~commentary: 1. this hadith enjoins good treatment of the slaves and
~~contains the elucidation that one should give them the same food and
~~clothes which one has for oneself, or one should give them such wages
~~that they can have the same food and clothes which he has for himself
~~because as far as religion and humanity are concerned, the slaves have
~~the status of one's brother, and their human needs are not different
~~from the needs of their masters. this order also applies to labourers
~~who work in factories, shops and homes. they should be given wages for
~~their work on the strict consideration that they are also human beings
~~and brothers - as if they are members of one's family. it is regrettable
~~indeed that these teachings of islam have been reglected in the islamic
~~countries. not to speak of treating them as brothers, the factory
~~owners, shopkeepers and capitalists of these countries are not prepared
~~to treat them as human beings. the result is that while these employers
~~are rolling in luxury, they do not give to their employees even such
~~wages which can suffice for their human needs. may allah grant them the
~~ability to act upon the teachings of their religion. 2. it is equally
~~important that the employees and labourers should not be burdened with
~~such heavy work which they are unable to bear. if the employees are ever
~~given any such work, the employers must share such work with them. 3.
~~pride on one's own ancestory and condemnation of others on this account
~~are remnants of the age of ignorance which were rooted out by islam.
~~muslims should keep themselves away from such vainglorious thoughts. it
~~is a pity that this evil of the pre-islamic age has now been adopted
~~again by muslims. we find it very common in the present-day muslim
~~societies. 4. by issuing the instruction mentioned in this hadith, islam
~~has arranged to establish equality in the true sense of the word. islam
~~does not make any claim of uniting the labour class and weaker segments
~~of the society for confrontation with the capitalists because this
~~breeds class hatred which ruins the peace and progress of the society.
~~instead of creating enmity, islam fosters brotherhood between the
~~employer and employed, the master and the slave, the ruler and the
~~ruled. it also exhorts them to be sympathetic and helpful to each other.
~~by stressing the rights of people, it teaches both classes to love and
~~respect each other. this is the reason why in islam the merit for
~~distinction is not wealth and abundance but faith and fear of allah
~~alone which even the poorest of the poor can possess and which may be
~~missing even in the richest of the rich in society. PageV01P1730

~~hadith has an inducement for them that if they embrace islam, they will
~~be entitled to a double reward. 2. similarly, a sincere and well-wishing
~~slave will also be entitled to a double reward because, on the one side,

~~and give it to him; verily the best of you is the one who is the best in
~~discharging his obligations (repayment of loans).'' [al-bukhari and
~~muslim]. commentary: 1. it is stated that the lender was zaid bin

~~because he who has a rightful claim, can tend to anger although he
~~should not cross the limits laid down by shari`ah in this respect. 2. at

~~debtor to pay with his own pleasure something more than due to the

~~sells, buys and demands for the repayment of loans.'' [al-bukhari].
~~commentary: "adopts a kind attitude when he sells, buys, and demands for

~~that the seller does not suffer any loss, and the seller sells his goods
~~in such a way that the buyer does not feel any irritation. this also
~~means that he feels so liberal that if the buyer wants to return what he
~~has purchased he should accept it. another meaning of this is that while
~~making a purchase the customer pays more than the due price and the
~~seller gives more goods than are due against the price that he receives.
~~moreover, if one has to get his claim from someone, he should do it in a
~~polite manner. in no case should one cross the limits of civility. if
~~the debtor is poor, he should be given more time for the repayment of

~~pleased with him) reported: the messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "he who
~~gives respite to someone who is in straitened circumstances, or grants
~~him remission, allah will shelter him in the shade of his throne, on the
~~day of resurrection, when there will be no shade except its shade.''
~~[at-tirmidhi]. commentary: on the day of resurrection, the sun will come
~~very close to people's heads who will then be badly sweating to the
~~extent that sweat will reach up to their ankles, or knees or shoulders;
~~some will be totally overwhelmed with their sweat (depending on their
~~sins). those people who will have the privilege of getting in the shade
~~of the throne will be then very lucky indeed. among such lucky people,
~~there will be a person who used not only to give loans to the poor and
~~the needy but also gave them convenience in the payment of their debts
~~or would forgive a part of the loan or all of it. this hadith has food
~~for thought for the affluent. nowadays people usually lend money to
~~people of their own status and do not like to give loan to the poor
~~because they think that it is difficult to recover from them. as far as
~~remitting a loan is concerned, we have totally forgotten this precept.
~~in any case, to refuse loan to a poor, when a person is in a position to
~~lend money to him, is hateful. to lend money to a needy and then to show
~~him leniency in its payment or to remit it altogether is a praiseworthy
~~act, the best reward for which will be given to him on the day of
~~resurrection. may allah enable us to be generous to the poor on this
~~account. PageV01P1747

~~i.e., envy. in islam, jealousy is forbidden and is held unlawful. the
~~reason being that one who is jealous wants that the person, who
~~possesses the quality of which he is jealous, be deprived of that
~~quality. envy is permissible for the reason that when one seems that a
~~person has been graced by allah with certain gifts and qualities, he
~~also desires to be blessed with those gifts. in the latter case, he does

~~knowledge with which allah has sent me are like abundant rain which fell
~~on a land. a fertile part of it absorbed the water and brought forth
~~profuse herbage and pasture; and solid ground patches which retained the
~~water by which allah has benefited people, who drank from it, irrigated
~~their crops and sowed their seeds; and another sandy plane which could
~~neither retain the water nor produce herbage. such is the similitude of
~~the person who becomes well-versed in the religion of allah and receives
~~benefit from the message entrusted to me by allah, so he himself has
~~learned and taught it to others; such is also the similitude of the
~~person who has stubbornly and ignorantly rejected allah's guidance with
~~which i have been sent.'' [al-bukhari and muslim] commentary: this
~~hadith has already been mentioned, and is repeated here to highlight the
~~eminence of knowledge and to induce muslims to gain it. we learn from
~~this hadith that there are three categories of people. first, those who
~~acquire knowledge of the qur'an and hadith, act upon it and also impart
~~it to others. such people benefit from this knowledge themselves and
~~extend this benefit to others also. by virtue of this quality they are
~~the best of all. second, those people who acquire knowledge and impart
~~it to others, but do not fulfill the requirements of that knowledge.
~~such people are inferior in rank to the people of the first category and
~~can be taken to task for their omissions. third, those who shun the
~~knowledge of the qur'an and hadith. neither they study and hear the two
~~themselves for their own benefit, nor do they acquire knowledge to
~~impart it to others for their benefit. this is the worst category of
~~people. every muslim should try to be in the first category of the
~~people. PageV01P1755

~~for every thing that is better than anything else. red camels used to be
~~precious in arabia, and their reference here is to highlight the value
~~of guidance. thus, this hadith brings into prominence the importance of
~~calling people towards allah. but before calling others to the path of

# وعن عبد الله بن عمرو بن العاص رضي الله عنه أن النبي صلى الله عليه و
~~سلم قال : [ بلغوا عني ولو آية وحدثوا عن بني إسرائيل ولا حرج ومن كذب علي
~~متعمدا فليتبوأ مقعده من النار ] رواه البخاري 1380. `abdullah bin `amr
~~bin al-`as (may allah be pleased with them) reported: the prophet (pbuh)
~~said, "convey from me even an ayah of the qur'an; relate traditions from
~~banu israel, and there is no restriction on that; but he who
~~deliberately forges a lie against me let him have his abode in the
~~hell.'' [al-bukhari]. commentary: this hadith contains the following
~~three important points: 1. it stresses the importance of acquiring
~~knowledge of the qur'an and hadith and imparting it to others. no matter
~~whether one has more or less knowledge, he must communicate it to
~~others. there is no justification to presume that preaching or inviting
~~to the message of allah is the duty of religious scholars and those who
~~are well-versed in this sphere. in fact, it is a duty upon every muslim,
~~so much so that if a person knows even a single verse of the qur'an,
~~that is to say if he knows only one injunction of allah, he is duty
~~bound to communicate it to other people. 2. it allows the communication
~~of jewish traditions but this permission is subject to the condition
~~that such traditions are not against the elucidations of the qur'an and
~~hadith. 3. there is a stern warning on attributing any false saying to
~~the prophet (pbuh). this demands strict scrutiny of ahadith. if a hadith
~~does not have a reliable authority or whose chain of narrators has a
~~false link or a person of doubtful integrity, that is to say if it is
~~weak, then it is a serious offense to quote it as a hadith of the
~~prophet (pbuh). there are various grades of weakness, and this requires
~~deep knowledge of the narrators and principles of hadith to know them
~~since scholars who are expert in this discipline are few and far. the
~~safest course for ordinary scholars is to refrain from stating such
~~ahadith which are weak, no matter whether the weakness is serious or
~~slight. the reason is that although the majority of muhaddithun consider
~~the slightly weak ahadith acceptable but they cannot be identified by
~~everybody. thus, every hadith which is marked as weak should not be
~~mentioned. in the present age sheikh nasiruddin al-albani has done a
~~very remarkable work in this field. he has separated the weak ahadith
~~found in the four famous volumes of ahadith (sunnan abu dawud, at-
~~tirmidhi, an-nasa'i and ibn majah) from the authentic and prepared
~~separate volumes of authentic and weak ahadith. this work of al-albani
~~has made it easy for the ordinary `ulama' to identify the weak ahadith.
~~only a man of sheikh al-albani's calibre can do research on it. the
~~ordinary `ulama' and religious scholars of the muslims are heavily
~~indebted to him for this great work and they should keep it in view
~~before mentioning any hadith. they should mention only the authentic
~~ahadith and refrain from quoting the weak ones. it is wrong to ignore
~~this work on the ground that sheikh al-albani is not the last word on
~~the subject. there can be a possibility of error in his work because it
~~is after all a human effort, but it will be very unfair to regard his
~~effort of no account merely because of a possible error. it is
~~regrettable indeed that only because of this possible error many people
~~refuse to accept even the correctness of the sahihain. (i.e., sahih al-
~~bukhari and sahih muslim). should we then accept their view? no,
~~certainly not. so there is no sense in not making use of sheikh al-
~~albani's matchless contribution. as muhaddithun have done a great
~~service to the muslim ummah by collecting and compiling the ahadith,
~~similarly in the style of muhaddithun, and in keeping with the
~~principles laid down by them, the research carried out to separate the
~~authentic ahadith from the weak is in fact an effort to complete their
~~mission. in this age, almighty allah has bestowed this honour on sheikh
~~al-albani. may allah protect him, give him the best of the reward and
~~give him a long life. we now revert to the subject under discussion and
~~say that no such saying and practice should be attributed to the prophet
~~(pbuh) the authenticity of which is doubtful. on this principle, weak
~~ahadith, should not be mentioned. it is very unfortunate indeed that in
~~spite of such a stern warning, many of our `ulama' are not careful in
~~this matter. not to speak of weak ahadith, they do not hesitate to
~~mention even ahadith maudu`ah forged ahadith) only to adorn their
~~speech. may allah guide them to the right path. in fact, there is a
~~class of religious scholars who try to refute the authentic ahadith and
~~validate the weak ones only to add credence to their own juristic
~~school. may allah save us from such evils. PageV01P1757

~~people will benefit from them, he will receive a reward for it. third,

~~tirmidhi]. commentary: `alim (learned person) here means scholar of the
~~qur'an and hadith, who adheres to faraid and sunnah and remains busy in
~~learning and imparting knowledge. `abid (devout worshipper) is one who
~~spends most of his time in the worship of allah. the benefit of his
~~voluntary prayer and remembrance of allah is restricted to his own self
~~while the benefit of knowledge of the scholar reaches others also.
~~hence, of the two, the latter is far superior. if salat is mentioned
~~with reference to allah, it denotes "allah's grace with mercy;'' if it
~~is mentioned with reference to the angels, it denotes "to pray for
~~forgiveness;'' and if it is mentioned with reference to other creatures
~~- men, animals, etc., - then it means prayer and supplication. thus,
~~allah graces that person with his mercy who teach people the beneficial
~~knowledge, i.e., the knowledge of islam; angels pray to allah to forgive
~~his (or her) sins; and other creatures pray for his (or her) well-being.

~~the sole intention of seeking the pleasure of allah but for worldly
~~gain, will not smell the fragrance of jannah on the day of

~~for acquiring knowledge for the pleasure of allah alone. if a religious
~~scholar acquires it to make it a means of worldly gains, then it turns
~~to such a serious crime that such a scholar will not even smell the
~~fragrance of jannah (i.e., he will not enter it along with the saved).

~~the result being that they will go astray and will lead others astray.''
~~[al-bukhari and muslim]. commentary: it is a sign of the nearness of the

~~dawud]. commentary: that "allah has prohibited the earth from consuming
~~the bodies of the prophets'' means that the earth does not consume them.
~~that "their salat (salutations) will be presented to him'' indicates
~~that angels present the salutation performed to him, as is elucidated in
~~other ahadith. moreover, his soul is then returned to him and he answers
~~the salutations also. (in the opinion of muhaddithun, the hadith

~~mention is made of me and he does not supplicate for me.'' [at-

~~humiliation and disgrace. that is "may such person be humiliated and
~~disgraced who hears my name and does not invoke allah's blessings upon
~~me.'' those who merely kiss thumbs of their hands can also be the
~~addressee of this saying because they do not supplicate allah for the

~~kissing of thumbs. the latter gesture has not been ordained in any

~~festivity, and supplicate allah for me, for your supplication reaches me
~~wherever you are.'' [abu dawud]. commentary: "do not make my grave a
~~place of festivity'' means do not gather there as people do on the
~~festival of `eid. unfortunately, a fraction of heretics consider such
~~festivities laudable. when the prophet (pbuh) did not like such
~~gatherings on his own grave, how can it be permissible on the death
~~anniversaries of other people? some people misinterpret this hadith and
~~contend that what it means is that `you should not come to my grave once
~~in a while but very frequently'' although its real meaning is that which
~~we have just mentioned. the next sentence confirms this contention.
~~there is no need for frequent gathering for the reason that wherever a
~~muslim may be, the salutations which he performs to the prophet (pbuh)
~~will be conveyed to him through the angels. every muslim has a desire to
~~visit the prophet's grave, and there cannot be any doubt about its
~~desirability, but there is no need to undertake journey for paying
~~homage and salutation only. in fact, the real intention of going to al-
~~madinah should be to visit prophet's mosque which will include visiting
~~his grave. this is the real meaning of this hadith. there is another
~~hadith which prohibits undertaking a journey to any mosque except the
~~three which have been marked by the prophet (pbuh). PageV01P1784

# وعنه رضي الله عنه أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم قال : [ ما من أحد
~~يسلم علي إلا رد الله علي روحي حتى أرد عليه السلام ] رواه أبو داود بإسناد
~~صحيح 1402. abu hurairah (may allah be pleased with him) reported: the
~~messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "whenever someone greets me, allah
~~returns the soul to my body (in the grave) and i return his greeting.''
~~[abu dawud]. commentary: we learn from this hadith that the prophet
~~(pbuh) is alive in his grave and he answers the salutation offered by a
~~muslim. but this life of his is the life of barzakh (an intervening
~~state between death and the day of resurrection, and whoever dies,
~~enters it) the reality of which is not known to us. thus, it is wrong to
~~say that the life of the prophet (pbuh) is like worldly life or more
~~vigorous than it. such a claim is baseless because it is not confirmed
~~by the qur'an and hadith. were he to be alive the way he was in his
~~lifetime, there would have been no need for "the returning of the soul
~~to his body'' and he would be able to answer the salutations without it.
~~as far this ambiguity is concerned, when countless muslims are always
~~offering salutations to the prophet (pbuh) how does the return of the
~~soul takes place after such short intervals? such questions arise due to
~~the lack of certitude in the omnipotence of allah. when the prophet
~~(pbuh) stated that his soul is returned to him then we should have
~~absolute faith in his statement because allah is capable of doing every
~~thing. what is its nature and form, it is not known to us, nor can we
~~know it. thus, the question of the return of soul in the grave should be
~~considered similar to the ambiguous ayat of the qur'an in which every
~~muslim is required to have blind faith but their secret is known to
~~allah alone. this hadith has an inducement for offering more and more
~~supplications for the prophet (pbuh) so that the devotee is blessed with
~~the maximum reward in the form of the prophet's response to his
~~salutations. it is certainly a great blessing which a muslim should try
~~every nerve to achieve. PageV01P1785

~~(may allah be pleased with him) reported: the messenger of allah (pbuh)
~~said, "the miser is the one in whose presence i am mentioned but he does
~~not supplicate for me.'' [at-tirmidhi]. commentary: "miser'' means to
~~deny someone his right. if a muslim does not supplicate for him upon
~~hearing his name, then such a person is a miser beyond doubt. thus, we
~~learn that one must recite salat when he hears the name of the prophet
~~(pbuh). it is sufficient to say may allah render him from evil and exalt

~~supplicating allah for the prophet (pbuh). with regard to him, the

~~beginning and then he should supplicate allah for me. then he may
~~supplicate for whatever he likes.'' [abu dawud and at-tirmidhi].
~~commentary: "fi salatihi" means that after the salat or at the end of
~~salat, he heard someone invoking allah. similarly, "idha salla

~~case, it is necessary to praise allah and supplicate him for the prophet

~~the manner taught by him. when almighty allah ordained muslims to
~~supplicate for the prophet (pbuh), it raised the question in their minds
~~as to the wordings of the benediction (as they already knew how to greet
~~him). they asked the prophet (pbuh) and he taught it. invoking allah's

~~(pbuh) and those of his relatives who were from banu hashim and banu
~~`abdul-muttalib and had embraced islam. some scholars are of the opinion
~~that it is general and applies to all his followers. this hadith also

~~must seek guidance from the knowledgeable scholars of islam about it,
~~rather than going by his opinion. knowledgeable persons (scholars) here

~~more than four wives to a muslim but the prophet (pbuh) was given the
~~exclusive permission for numerous considerations which have been
~~discussed by religious scholars at length. this hadith also refutes the
~~opinion of those who do not include his pious wives in the category of
~~his "al''. the progeny of the prophet (pbuh) includes his male and
~~female children and their descendants. but after his death none except
~~fatimah (may allah be pleased with her) and her children remained alive.

~~"there are two statements that are light for the tongue to remember,
~~heavy in the scales and are dear to the merciful: `subhan-allahi wa
~~bihamdihi, subhan-allahil-azim [glory be to allah and his is the praise,

~~muslim]. commentary: this hadith affirms that man's actions carry
~~weight. on the day of judgement, his actions will be cast into the
~~balance. at that time allah will endow these actions with weight, or
~~according to some scholars, those records which register man's actions
~~will be weighed. this is quite possible for the reason that almighty
~~allah is capable of weighing things without even their physical form.
~~this discussion apart, when actions will be cast into the balance, the
~~formula mentioned in the hadith, the utterance of which is very easy,
~~will prove weighty. every muslim should make it a practice to repeat
~~them frequently. PageV01P1794

~~free from imperfection)' fills the balance, and the expression: `al-
~~hamdu lillah (praise be to allah)' fills the space between the heavens
~~and the earth.'' [muslim]. commentary: "tuhur'' is purification or
~~wudu', while "tahur'' is water or something which is used for
~~purification. according to some scholars, `faith'' means salat. this is
~~also the sense in which it has been used in the qur'an: "and allah would
~~never make your faith to be lost (i.e., your prayers).'' [2:143]. thus
~~when salat is the faith, the purification is a prerequisite for salat.
~~salat is not valid without purification. some scholars are of the
~~opinion that faith here means faith in general, as the shari`ah defines
~~it: to sincerely accept and believe in all that the prophet (pbuh) came
~~with, i.e., sincere acceptance of allah and his prophet (pbuh).
~~"purification is half of the faith'' means the acceptance that
~~purification is the most important article of faith. it is like the
~~saying of the prophet (pbuh) that "hajj is `arafah'', which means that
~~`arafat (the place where the pilgrims stay on the 9th day of dhul-
~~hijjah) is the most important element of the hajj. thus, this hadith
~~stresses the importance and merits of purification and offers an
~~inducement for it. it also mentions the eminence of the invocations
~~mentioned in the hadith by saying that if they are given a form, they
~~will fill the space between the heavens and the earth. in other words,
~~it is a description of the infinite vastness of the mercy and grace of

~~maghfir li dhanbi kullahu: diqqahu wa jillahu, wa `awwalahu wa akhirahu,
~~wa alaniyatahu wa sirrahu (o allah! forgive all my sins, the small and
~~the great, first and the last, the open and the secret).'' [muslim].
~~commentary: although the prophet (pbuh) was innocent and free of sins,
~~he used to pray for the forgiveness of his shortcomings out of his
~~gratitude to allah's might and majesty. thus, this hadith has a great
~~lesson for us. in spite of being innocent, he was always fearful of the
~~wrath of allah, while we, despite being embodiments of sins, are
~~fearless of allah. PageV01P1815

~~1435. abu hurairah (may allah be pleased with him) reported: the

~~slave expects me to be, and i am with him when he remembers me. if he
~~remembers me inwardly, i will remember him inwardly, and if he remembers
~~me in an assembly, i will remember him in a better assembly (i.e., in
~~the assembly of angels).'' [al-bukhari and muslim]. commentary: "i am as
~~my slave expects me to be'' means that one should have the conviction
~~that he accepts repentance, grants pardon, relieves people of their
~~tensions and emancipates them from their troubles. along with this
~~conviction one should do good deeds which please allah and avoid such
~~deeds which have been prohibited by him. with this conduct, one should
~~hope for the best from allah. this approach is similar to that of a
~~cultivator who ploughs his land, sows the seed, waters it, takes every
~~possible care of it and then cherishes hope for a good crop. it can also
~~be linked to the endeavours of a person who intends to become a scholar,
~~or a physician or an engineer. the first and foremost requirement to
~~pursue his ambition is to study the books through which he can gain the
~~required knowledge. for every work one intends to do, one has to first
~~make a foundation and then acquire the means essential for it. it is
~~only then that one can hope to achieve one's aim. similar is the case of
~~associating good hopes with allah. unless a person does not furnish the
~~foundation of faith and good deeds for it, it will be unwise to
~~associate good hopes with allah. a slave who rather than serving his
~~master runs away or annoys him and still hopes that his master being so
~~kind will not take him to task for his excesses would be called stupid
~~by the people. the same is true of allah, who is certainly the most
~~compassionate, the most merciful and forgiving. but for whom is he so?
~~the answer is for his faithful and obedient slaves and not for those who
~~are followers of satan. for satan and his followers, allah's decision is
~~that: "i will fill hell with you (iblis) and those of them (mankind)
~~that follow you, together.'' (38:85). PageV01P1821

~~the plural of shari`ah shari`ah is in the sense of mashru`ah, that is
~~the divine injunctions. these divine injunctions are of various kinds,
~~i.e., some of them are obligatory, some desirable and some voluntary.
~~the obligatory ones are compulsory and their compliance is
~~indispensable. what is termed as mustahabbat (desirables) are also
~~highly important for gaining the pleasure of allah. similarly, voluntary
~~acts are a means of getting close to allah. ordinary people are
~~sometimes puzzled by the abundance of the latter and want to adhere to
~~the first two, that is obligations and what comes in the category of
~~desirables. a desire to this effect is mentioned in this hadith. the
~~prophet (pbuh) answered the query in this matter by saying to the
~~inquirer, "keep your tongue wet with the remembrance of allah.'' keeping
~~the tongue wet with the remembrance of allah here means its abundant
~~recitation. in other words, one should make the remembrance of allah a
~~permanent feature. if one is not able to do many voulntary good works,

~~all times. [muslim]. commentary: such religious scholars take support
~~from this hadith who hold that the recitation of the qur'an is
~~permissible in a state of janabah (resulting from coition) and menses.
~~imam al-bukhari is also included among those who hold this view. they
~~say that the words "at all times'' clearly means that. the prophet
~~(pbuh) used to remember allah (which includes the recitation of the
~~qur'an also) no matter whether he was in a state of minor or major
~~pollution. for this reason, sheikh al-albani has objected imam an-
~~nawawi's mentioning these two exceptions (pollution resulting from
~~coition and menses) in the relevant title, and has stated that there is
~~no hadith in support of these exceptions. in fact, the hadith narrated
~~by `a ishah (may allah be pleased with her) contradicts this view. in
~~the opinion of this school of thought, the ahadith which prohibit the
~~remembrance of allah when a person is in the state of janabah are weak
~~in authority and are open to discussion. thus, such ahadith do not prove
~~the prohibition. in the opinion of the second school of thought, which
~~holds the opposite view, such ahadith carry weight despite being weak in
~~authority, because their weakness is not serious. some of them even
~~believe that such ahadith come to the level of hadith hasan. so far
~~logic is concerned, the viewpoint of the first school carries more
~~weight but the reverence of the qur'an also calls for caution. the best
~~way to create conformity between the two views is that in inevitable

# 1447. abu hurairah (may allah be pleased with him) reported: the

~~who go about on the roads seeking those who remember allah. when they
~~find some people remembering allah they call to one another and say,
~~`come to what you are looking for;' and they surround them with their
~~wings till the space between them and the lowest sky is fully covered.
~~allah, the exalted and glorious, asks them (although he is best informed
~~about every thing): `what are my slave saying?' they say: `they are
~~glorifying your tasbih, tahmid, takbir, tamjid, (i.e., they were
~~declaring your perfectness, praising, remembering the greatness and
~~majesty of allah).' he asks: `have they seen me?' they reply, `no,
~~indeed, they have not seen you.' he asks: `how would they act if they
~~were to see me?' thereupon they reply: `if they were to see you, they
~~would engage more earnestly in worshipping and glorifying you and would
~~extol you more.' he would say: `what do they beg of me?' they say, `they
~~beg you for your jannah.' allah says, `have they seen my jannah?' they
~~say, `no, our rubb.' he says: `how would they act if they were to see my
~~jannah?' they reply, `were they to see it, they would more intensely
~~eager for it.' they (the angels) say, `they seek your protection.' he
~~asks, `against what do they seek my protection?' they (the angels) say,
~~`our rubb, from the fire of hell.' (he, the rubb) says, `have they seen
~~the fire of hell?' they say, `no. by your honour, they have not seen
~~it.' he says: `how would they act if they were to see my fire?' they
~~say: `if they were to see it, they would more earnest in being away from
~~it and fearing it. they beg of your forgiveness.' he says: `i call you
~~to witness that i hereby grant pardon to them and confer upon them what
~~they ask for; and grant them protection against what they seek
~~protection from.' one of the angels says: `our rubb, there is amongst
~~them such and such slave who does not belong to the assembly of those
~~who are participating in your remembrance. he passed by them and sat
~~down with them.' he says: `i also grant him pardon because they are the
~~people by virtue of whom their associates will not be unfortunate'.''
~~[al-bukhari and muslim]. (the narration in muslim is also the same with
~~minor changes in wordings). commentary: what kind of circles and
~~gatherings of remembrance of allah are referred to here? obviously not
~~those in which allah is remembered in the ways invented by the
~~participants themselves, i.e., repetition of the slogans "allah-hu'',
~~"haq-allah'', etc.,which have not been mentioned in any hadith. the
~~repetition of any specific word, in a specific manner and in a peculiar
~~surrounding (such as by putting the lights off) - this manner of
~~conducting the remembrance of allah is also not evident from the
~~practice of the prophet (pbuh) and his companions. the circles and
~~gatherings mentioned in this hadith are those in which, the prophet's
~~sunnah is fully observed. the words such as subhan-allah, al-hamdu
~~lillah, la ilaha illallah, allahu akbar etc., are recited and praise and
~~glorification of allah are done after salat. the groups are quietly
~~engaged in the remembrance of allah, and those who attend the sermons
~~and speeches delivered in mosques on friday also come in this category
~~of meetings and gatherings as these are ordained in islam. this hadith

~~nu`man bin bashir (may allah be pleased with them) reported: the prophet

~~what is prayer but an expression of one's humbleness and helplessness
~~before allah. the expression of one's weakness, inferiority and
~~lowliness before the infinite power and might of allah is in fact the
~~essence of worshipping him. for this reason, prayer has been regarded as
~~the essence of worship. thus, prayer is reserved for him alone and it
~~should not be addressed to anyone else in any case. al-qadi `iyad said
~~that du`a is that act of worship which alone deserves to be referred to

~~he does not like and approve. PageV01P1863

~~(may allah be pleased with him) reported: the prophet (pbuh) said, "seek
~~refuge in allah against the turmoils, attacks of misfortunes, and evil
~~of judgement and joys of the enemies.'' [al-bukhari and muslim].
~~commentary: the trouble of a trial which is unbearable for a person and
~~from which he does not have the power to rid himself is called (juhd al-
~~bala'), translated here as `turmoils'. some people are of the opinion
~~that it is synonymous with poverty combined with abundant children. but
~~al-hafiz ibn hajar is of the view that it is only one of the several
~~kinds of "troubles of a trial.'' "ash-shaqa' is the opposite of good
~~fortune, that is, to pray for protection from misfortune. no decision of
~~allah is wrong but some of his decisions may be harmful for certain
~~people while others are beneficial for them. this means that their
~~goodness or badness is related to persons. what it signifies is that one
~~should pray to allah to keep one safe from such decisions which are
~~harmful for him. "shamatat'' the pleasure that one's enemy feels on
~~one's trouble. in other words, it is prayed that allah may protect one
~~from any such trouble which is pleasing to one's enemy, because when a
~~person is in trouble, his enemies feel pleasure over it. in this hadith,
~~one sentence was added by abu sufyan and during his old age he did not
~~remember which one it was. but we learn from other ahadith that it was
~~"the pleasure of enemies''. (ibn `allan). this hadith also shows the
~~honesty and integrity of the narrators of ahadith. they were honest to
~~the extent that if a few words of supplication were added to a hadith by
~~its narrators, they would point it out. some scholars have regarded
~~these words an addition in the hadith by its narrator, who is otherwise
~~reliable, but it is not a problem of "addition of authority'' because in
~~that case, the addition is the saying of the prophet (pbuh) which is
~~mentioned by one narrator and omitted by another. but here it is quite
~~different as the narrator of the hadith himself is pointing out the
~~addition made by him. such additional words are technically called
~~"mudraj'' PageV01P1869

~~[muslim]. commentary: this is also a very comprehensive prayer. allah

~~a blessing is realized at its loss. for eyes, ears, tongue, health,
~~property, children and such countless blessings, we owe gratitude to
~~allah. in the prayer cited in this hadith, one entreats allah not to
~~deprive of any blessing given to him. `afiyah means safe from disease,

~~said: "o messenger of allah! what does growing impatient mean?'' he

# 1503. `abdur-rahman bin abu bakr (may allah be pleased with them)
~~reported: the companions of as-suffah were poor people. the prophet
~~(pbuh) said, "whoever has food enough for two people, should take a
~~third one (from among them), and whoever has food enough for four
~~persons, should take a fifth or sixth (or said something similar).'' abu
~~bakr (may allah be pleased with him) took three people with him while
~~messenger of allah (pbuh) took ten. abu bakr (may allah be pleased with
~~him) took his supper with the prophet (pbuh) and stayed there till he
~~offered the `isha' prayers. after a part of the night had passed, he
~~returned to his house. his wife said to him: "what has detained you from
~~your guests?'' he said: "have you not served supper to them?'' she said:
~~"they refused to take supper until you come.'' [abdur-rahman (abu bakr's
~~son) or the servants] presented the meal to them but they refused to
~~eat. i (the narrator) hid myself out of fear. abu bakr (may allah be
~~pleased with him) (my father) rebuked me. then he said to them: "please
~~eat. by allah! i will never eat the meal.'' `abdur-rahman added:
~~whenever we took a morsel of the meal, the meal grew from underneath
~~more than that morsel we had till everybody ate to his satisfaction; yet
~~the remaining food was more than what was in the beginning. on seeing
~~this, abu bakr (may allah be pleased with him) called his wife and said:
~~"o sister of banu firas! what is this?'' she said: "o pleasure of my
~~eyes! the food has increased thrice in quantity.'' then abu bakr (may
~~allah be pleased with him) started eating. he said: "my oath not to take
~~the meal was because of satan.'' he took a morsel handful from it and
~~carried the rest to the prophet (pbuh). that food remained with him. in
~~those days there was a treaty between us and the pagans and when the
~~period of that treaty elapsed, he (pbuh) divided us into twelve groups
~~and every group was headed by a man. allah knows how many men were under
~~the command of each leader. anyhow, all of them ate of that meal. [al-
~~bukhari and muslim]. there are some more narrations in both al-bukhari
~~and muslim with very minor differences in wordings and in details.
~~commentary: we learn the following points from this hadith: 1. it is
~~permissible to take students of religious schools home for meals, as was
~~the practice in certain areas in the past. 2. a father can admonish his
~~children for disciplinary purposes. 3. if a better situation develops,
~~one can break his vow and go for the new and better choice. it is,
~~however, necessary to expiate for breaking the vow. 4. this hadith
~~affirms miracles. this is evident from the fact that a small quantity of
~~food was so blessed by allah that all the members of the family, guests,
~~the prophet (pbuh) and twelve "arif'' (leader) along with their
~~companions took that food. (gist of the text of hadith from fath al-
~~bari, kitab al-manaq.) PageV01P1906

~~(the recipients of divine inspiration) among the nations before you. if
~~there is any of such muhaddith among my followers, he must be `umar.''
~~[al-bukhari]. in muslim, this hadith is narrated by `aishah (may allah

~~commentary: "mulhamun'' [persons endowed with inspiration]; in other
~~words, things are put in their hearts by allah, it was done in the case
~~of the mother of prophet musa. it was put in her mind by allah that if
~~she felt any fear, she should then trust the child to the sea. maryam

# وعن جابر بن سمرة رضي الله عنه قال : شكا أهل الكوفة سعدا ( يعني ابن

~~1505. jabir bin samurah (may allah be pleased with them) said: the
~~inhabitants of kufah complained to `umar (may allah be pleased with him)
~~against sa`d bin abu waqqas (may allah be pleased with him) and `umar
~~(may allah be pleased with him) appointed `ammar (may allah be pleased
~~with him) as governor of kufah in his place. their complaint was that he
~~did not even conduct as-salat (the prayers) properly. `umar (may allah
~~be pleased with him) sent for sa`d and said to him: "o abu ishaq, the
~~people claim that you do not offer the salat properly.'' sa`d replied:
~~"by allah! i observe salat according to the salat of the messenger of
~~allah (pbuh), and i make no decrease in it. i prolong qiyam (standing)
~~in the first two rak`ah in maghrib and `isha' prayers and shorten in the
~~last ones.'' `umar (may allah be pleased with him) said: "this is what i
~~thought of you, o abu ishaq!'' then he sent with him a man (or some men)
~~to kufah to investigate the matter about him (from the people of kufah).
~~the inquiry was conducted in every mosque and all the people in these
~~mosques praised him; but in the mosque of the banu `abs, a man, with the
~~name of usamah bin qatadah and surname abu sa`dah, stood up and said,
~~"sa`d bin abu waqqas did not participate in jihad and he did not
~~distribute the spoils equitably and did not judge justly.'' on this sa`d
~~said: "i shall make three supplications in respect of him: o allah! if
~~this slave of yours is a liar and seeker of notoriety, please prolong
~~his life and lengthen his period of adversity and afflict him with
~~trials.'' (and so did it happen.) thereafter, when the man was asked
~~about his condition he would say, "i am an old man afflicted with trials
~~and overtaken by the curses of sa`d.'' `abdul-malik bin `umair (a
~~subnarrator) said: i saw this man with eyebrows hung over his eyes as a
~~result of his old age and he walked aimlessly, following young girls and
~~winking at them. [al-bukhari and muslim]. commentary: this hadith brings
~~out the following four points: 1. the distinction of sa`d bin abu waqqas
~~(may allah be pleased with him) and the fact that his prayers were
~~granted by allah. 2. the principle that if inquiry is conducted against
~~anybody, one should inquire the opinion of the righteous and worthy
~~people about the person against whom complaint is made. 3. government
~~officials can be dismissed in the interest of public good, as `umar (may
~~allah be pleased with him) dismissed sa`d bin abu waqqas although the
~~complaints made against him were false, but `umar thought it wise to
~~dismiss him so that no one amongst his subject would show hatred towards
~~him. 4. this hadith also proves the correctness of marvels. the
~~acceptance of the prayer of sa`d bin abu waqqas is an instance of it.

~~reported: arwa bint aus brought a suit against sa`id bin zaid bin `amr
~~bin nufail (may allah be pleased with him). she complained to marwan bin
~~al-hakam that he had wrongfully taken possession of a portion of her
~~land. sa`id said: "how can i take a portion out of her land while i have
~~heard a denunciation from the messenger of allah (pbuh).'' marwan asked
~~him: "what did you hear from the messenger of allah?'' he said, "i heard
~~the messenger of allah (pbuh) saying, `he who takes a span of land
~~unjustly will be made to wear seven earths round his neck on the day of
~~ressurection'.'' marwan said to him: "i don't seek proof from you after
~~this.'' sa`id supplicated: "o allah! if she is a liar, deprive her of
~~her eye sight and cause her to die in her land.'' `urwah said: "she did
~~not die till she became blind. while she was walking in her land
~~(concerning which the dispute arose) she fell down into a pit and
~~died.'' [al-bukhari and muslim]. in another narration of muslim,
~~muhammad bin zaid bin `abdullah bin `umar said that he had seen arwa
~~blind, feeling for on the walls with her hand and saying: "i am ruined
~~by the curse of sa`id.'' later she fell in a well in the same disputed
~~land and died. commentary: sa`id bin zaid was an eminent companion of
~~the prophet (pbuh) and had the honour of being one from the group of al
~~-`ashratul-mubashsharuna bil-jannah marwan bin al-hakam (may allah be
~~pleased with him) was governor of al-madinah during the caliphate of
~~mu`awiyah, and the incident quoted in this hadith relates to that
~~particular period. after mu`awiyah bin yazid, he remained caliph for
~~some months. this hadith brings into prominence the following points: 1.
~~the distinction of sa`id bin zaid and the marvel which came about with
~~the acceptance of his prayer by allah. 2. one should always save oneself
~~from the curse of the pious people because the punishment can occur in

~~leave him with another in the grave. so i dug up his corpse after six
~~months and he was in the same condition in which he was on the day when
~~i buried him, except that there was a scratch on his ear. then i buried
~~him in a separate grave. [al-bukhari]. commentary: this hadith
~~highlights the following five points: 1. the companions' love for the
~~prophet (pbuh) exceeded everything else, even one's own life and
~~children. 2. the companions' ardent desire for martyrdom. 3. the sixth
~~sense of jabir's father that he would be honoured with martyrdom. 4. the

# 1509. abu hurairah (may allah be pleased with him) reported: the
~~messenger of allah (pbuh) sent an espionage mission of ten men under the
~~leadership of `asim bin thabit al-ansari (may allah be pleased with
~~him). they proceeded till they reached al-had'ah, a place between `usfan
~~and makkah and the news of their arrival reached a section of the tribe
~~of hudhail, called banu lihyan. about one hundred men, who were all
~~archers, hurried to follow their tracks. when `a sim and his companions
~~came to know of their pursuers, they took refuge in a safe place. the
~~infidels encircled them and said to them: "come down and surrender, and
~~we promise and guarantee you that we will not kill anyone of you.''
~~`asim bin thabit (may allah be pleased with him) said: "by allah! i will
~~not come down to be under the protection of disbelievers. o allah!
~~convey this news to our prophet (pbuh).'' then the infidels shot arrows
~~at them till they killed `asim. three men came down relying on their
~~promise and covenant. they were khubaib, zaid bin ad-dathinah and
~~another man. when the disbelievers captured them, they tied them up with
~~the strings of their bows. the third of the captives said: "this is the
~~beginning of first betrayal. by allah! i will not go with you. i have a
~~good example in these (martyrs).'' so they dragged him and tried to
~~compel him to accompany them, but he refused. at last they killed him.
~~they took khubaib and zaid bin ad-dathina with them and sold them as
~~slaves in makkah. this incident took place after the battle of badr.
~~khubaib was bought by the sons of al-harith bin `amir bin naufal bin
~~`abd manaf. it was khubaib who had killed al-harith in the battle of
~~badr. khubaib remained a prisoner with those people for a few days till
~~the sons of al-harith resolved to kill him. when khubaib (may allah be
~~pleased with him) got wind of this plot, he borrowed a razor from one of
~~al-harith's daughters in order to remove his pubic hair. her little son
~~crawled towards khubaib because of her carelessness. later on, she saw
~~her son on his thigh and the razor was in his hand. she got scared so
~~much that khubaib noticed the agitation on her face and said: "are you
~~afraid that i will kill him? no, i will never do that.'' she later
~~remarked (after al-khubaib got martyred): "by allah! i never saw a
~~prisoner better than khubaib.'' she added: "by allah! i saw him once
~~eating of a bunch of grapes in his hand while he was chained and there
~~was no such fruit at that time in makkah. probably it was a boon which
~~allah bestowed upon khubaib.'' when they took him out of the haram of
~~makkah to kill him outside its boundaries, khubaib requested them to let
~~him offer two rak`ah of voluntary prayer. they allowed him and he
~~offered two rak`ah prayer. then he said: "had i not apprehended that you
~~would think that i was afraid of death, i would have prolonged the
~~prayer. o allah! count their number; slay them one by one and spare not
~~one of them.'' he then recited these poetic verses: `i do not care how
~~they kill me as long as i get martyred in the cause of allah as a
~~muslim. i received my death for allah's sake. if allah so desires, he
~~will bless, the amputated limbs of the torn body.' then the son of al-
~~harith killed him. it was khubaib who set the tradition for any muslim
~~sentenced to death in captivity to offer two rak`ah of voluntary prayer.
~~on that day the messenger of allah (pbuh) informed his companions of the
~~martyrdom of khubaib. later on, when some disbelievers from quraish were
~~informed that `asim had been martyred, they sent some people to fetch a
~~significant part of his body to ascertain his death. (this was because)
~~`asim had killed one of their chiefs. so allah sent a swarm of wasps,
~~resembling a shady cloud, to hover over the body of `asim and to shield
~~him from their messengers, and thus they could not cut off anything from
~~his body. [al-bukhari]. commentary: "raht'' means a group or party. some
~~people say it consisted of six persons - `asim bin thabit, marthad bin
~~abu marthad, khubaib bin `adi, zaid bin ad-dathina, `abdullah bin tariq
~~and khalid bin bukair (may allah be pleased with him) some say that it
~~comprised ten persons. allah knows better. the incident reported in this
~~hadith has many miracles and marvels. for instance, according to his
~~prayer, the news of his assassination was conveyed by allah through wahy
~~to the prophet (pbuh) on the very day when he was martyred and he (pbuh)
~~informed his companions about it. second, allah provided khubaib with
~~grapes when they were out of season during his imprisonment. third,
~~allah sent wasps for the safety of `asim's corpse. fourth, his enemies
~~met with the evil end which he had imprecated for them. this hadith
~~brings forth the following six points: 1. if one's enemy shows
~~strictness and oppression, then he should not accept the offer of
~~protection from them even if he is killed as a result of this. one can,
~~however, try to save his life if he sees some signs of leniency in the
~~enemy's attitude. 2. the matchless perseverance and steadfastness of the
~~companions of the prophet (pbuh) and their patience on the tyrannies
~~perpetrated on them by their enemies. 3. even in the worst of
~~circumstances, the companion of the prophet (pbuh) (i.e., khubaib)
~~maintained the best standard of morality and did not harm the enemy's
~~child in any way. 4. if the enemy is bent upon killing, then it is
~~permissible to request them for permission to offer two rak`ah of
~~voluntary salat because this act of khubaib (may allah be pleased with
~~him) was upheld by the prophet (pbuh). 5. it is lawful to imprecate for
~~oppressors and disbelievers. there are many ahadith on the validity of
~~marvels and miracles which have been mentioned in the present book in
~~different chapters. the following instances can be quoted in this
~~respect: 1. the incident of the boy who used to visit a priest and a
~~magician. (see the chapter on patience). 2. the story of juraij (which
~~occurs in the chapter on sincerity). 3. the story of the men of the
~~cave, the entrance of which was closed with a huge stone. (the chapter
~~on generosity). 4. the story of the man who had heard the voice from the
~~clouds ordering them to shower rain on a particular garden (the chapter
~~on generosity). many other incidents also come in this category which
~~are supported by evidence and are well-known. allah is capable of doing
~~everything. PageV01P1912

~~in our everyday life. sometimes a person utters a good sentence which
~~pleases an individual and he reforms himself or holds himself from doing
~~something wrong. such a sentence or utterance is highly rewarded by
~~allah. similarly, sometime a person utters a mischievous sentence, the

~~[at-tirmidhi]. commentary: faith in allah and all his attributes is the

~~without this faith, "and then remain steadfast'' means to comply with

~~slightest carelessness on the part of the tongue can make all the organs
~~suffer for it. crookedness of the tongue means the careless use of the
~~tongue which lands the whole body in trouble; and keeping the tongue

~~(pbuh): "inform me of an act which will cause me to enter jannah and
~~keep me far from hell.'' he (pbuh) replied, "you have asked me about a
~~matter of great importance, but it is easy for one for whom allah makes
~~it easy.'' he added, "worship allah, associate nothing with him in
~~worship, offer as-salat (the prayer), pay the zakat, observe saum
~~(fasting) during ramadan and perform hajj (pilgrimage) to the house of
~~allah, if you can afford it.'' he (pbuh) further said, "shall i not
~~guide you to the gates of goodness? fasting is a screen (from hell),
~~charity extinguishes (i.e., removes) the sins as water extinguishes
~~fire, and standing in prayers by a slave of allah during the last third
~~part of the night.'' then he recited: "their sides forsake their beds,
~~to invoke their rubb in fear and hope, and they spend (in charity in
~~allah's cause) out of what we have bestowed on them. no person knows
~~what is kept hidden for them of joy as a reward for what they used to
~~do.'' (32:17,18) then he added, "shall i tell you of the root of the
~~matter, its pillar and its highest point?'' i replied: "yes! certainly,
~~o prophet of allah.'' he said, "the root of this matter (foundation) is
~~islam, its pillar (mainstay is) as-salat (the prayer) and its highest
~~point is jihad (fighting in the cause of allah).'' then he asked, "shall
~~i tell you of that which holds all these things?'' i said: "yes, o

~~in control.'' i asked: "o messenger of allah! shall we really be
~~accounted for what we talk about?'' he replied, "may your mother lose
~~you! people will be thrown on their faces into the hell on account of
~~their tongues.'' commentary: besides describing articles of islam, this
~~hadith mentions the dangers which lie in the careless use of the tongue.

~~commentary: this hadith tells us that the tenth day of the month of

~~blood, property and honour of a muslim to another muslim. in other
~~words, a muslim should neither kill another without any lawful reason

~~من أبلغ الزواجر عن الغيبة قال الله تعالى : { وما ينطق عن الهوى إن هو إلا
~~وحي يوحى } 1525. `aishah (may allah be pleased with her) said: i said to
~~the prophet (pbuh): "such and such thing of safiyyah (may allah be
~~pleased with her) is sufficient for you.'' (she means to say that she
~~was a woman with a short stature). he said, "you have indeed uttered a
~~word which would pollute the sea if it were mixed in it.'' she further
~~said: i imitated a person before him and he said, "i do not like that i
~~should imitate someone even (if i am paid) in return such and such.''
~~[abu dawud and at-tirmidhi]. commentary: in arabic, the word "muhakat''
~~is often used for imitating someone's defect or deformity, etc. every
~~imitation of this kind also amounts to backbiting. this is the reason
~~the prophet (pbuh) used the analogy stated in this hadith when `aishah
~~(may allah be pleased with her) said that safiyyah (may allah be pleased
~~with her) was short-statured. imam an-nawawi regarded this analogy as
~~based on wahy and supported his contention by the verse of the qur'an:
~~"nor does he speak of (his own) desire. it is only a revelation
~~revealed.'' thus, it is evident from this hadith that to speak of
~~somebody in a scornful manner, or ridicule someone's physical defect, or
~~to imitate someone's deformity, or talk disparagingly about someone, is
~~a great offense which should be avoided by every muslim. PageV01P1931

~~of his cloak and an appreciation of his sides have allured him, and he
~~was thus detained.'' mu`adh bin jabal (may allah be pleased with him)
~~said: "woe be upon you! you have passed indecent remarks. o messenger of
~~allah! by allah, we know nothing about him but good.'' the messenger of
~~allah (pbuh) remained silent. [al-bukhari and muslim]. commentary: this
~~hadith has already been mentioned in detail in the chapter on
~~repentance. here it is repeated to show how important it is to defend a
~~muslim when someone accuses him in his absence. in the presence of the
~~prophet (pbuh) a person expressed misgivings about ka`b bin malik that
~~his obsession (for fine dress) had prevented him from coming to the
~~battlefield. mu`adh immediately defended him saying that there was no
~~justification for such misgivings. the prophet's silence endorsed the
~~stand taken by mu`adh (may allah be pleased with him). this goes to
~~prove that if a muslim brother or sister is disgraced in his or her
~~absence in a gathering, then it is incumbent on others to defend his or
~~her honour. PageV01P1938

### || AUT 256 - باب بيان ما يباح من الغيبة
# chapter 256 some cases where it is permissible to backbite
~~PageV01P1939
# اعلم أن الغيبة تباح لغرض صحيح شرعي لا يمكن الوصول إليه إلا بها وهو ستة
~~أسباب : الأول التظلم فيجوز للمظلوم أن يتظلم إلى السلطان والقاضي وغيرهما
~~ممن له ولاية أو قدرة على إنصافه من ظالمه فيقول : ظلمني فلان بكذا الثاني
~~الاستعانة على تغيير المنكر ورد العاصي إلى الصواب فيقول لمن يرجو قدرته
~~على إزالة المنكر : فلان يعمل كذا فازجره عنه ونحو ذلك ويكون مقصوده التوصل
~~إلى إزالة المنكر فإن لم يقصد ذلك كان حراما الثالث الاستفتاء فيقول للمفتي
~~: ظلمني أبي أو أخي أو زوجي أو فلان بكذا فهل له ذلك ؟ وما طريقي في الخلاص
~~منه وتحصيل حقي ودفع الظلم ؟ ونحو ذلك فهذا جائز للحاجة ولكن الأحوط
~~والأفضل أن يقول : ما تقول في رجل أو شخص أو زوج كان من أمره كذا ؟ فإنه
~~يحصل به الغرض من غير تعيين ومع ذلك فالتعيين جائز كما سنذكره في حديث هند
~~( انظر الحديث رقم 1532 ) إن شاء الله تعالى الرابع تحذير المسلمين من الشر
~~ونصيحتهم وذلك من وجوه منها جرح المجروحين من الرواة والشهود وذلك جائز
~~بإجماع المسلمين بل واجب للحاجة . ومنها المشاورة في مصاهرة إنسان أو
~~مشاركته أو إيداعه أو معاملته أو غير ذلك أو مجاورته ويجب على المشاور أن
~~لا يخفي حاله بل يذكر المساوئ التي فيه بنية النصيحة . ومنها إذا رأى
~~متفقها يتردد إلى مبتدع أو فاسق يأخذ عنه العلم وخاف أن يتضرر المتفقه بذلك
~~فعليه نصيحته ببيان حاله بشرط أن يقصد النصيحة وهذا مما يغلط فيه وقد يحمل
~~المتكلم بذلك الحسد ويلبس الشيطان عليه ذلك ويخيل إليه أنه نصيحة فليتفطن
~~لذلك . ومنها أن يكون له ولاية لا يقوم بها على وجهها إما بأن لا يكون
~~صالحا لها وإما بأن يكون فاسقا أو مغفلا ونحو ذلك فيجب ذكر ذلك لمن له عليه
~~ولاية عامة ليزيله ويولي من يصلح أو يعلم ذلك منه ليعامله بمقتضى حاله ولا
~~يغتر به وأن يسعى في أن يحثه على الاستقامة أو يستبدل به الخامس أن يكون
~~مجاهرا بفسقه أو بدعته كالمجاهر بشرب الخمر ومصادرة الناس وأخذ المكس
~~وجباية الأموال ظلما وتولي الأمور الباطلة فيجوز ذكره بما يجاهر به ويحرم
~~ذكره بغيره من العيوب إلا أن يكون لجوازه سبب آخر مما ذكرناه السادس
~~التعريف فإذا كان الإنسان معروفا بلقب كالأعمش والأعرج والأصم والأعمى
~~والأحول وغيرهم جاز تعريفهم بذلك ويحرم إطلاقه على جهة التنقص ولو أمكن
~~تعريفه بغير ذلك كان أولى فهذه ستة أسباب ذكرها العلماء وأكثرها مجمع عليه
~~. ودلائلها من الأحاديث الصحيحة المشهورة فمن ذلك : PageV01P1940
# [backbiting is permissible only for valid reasons approved by
~~shari`ah. these reasons are as follows:] 1. it is permissible for an
~~oppressed person to speak before the judge or someone in a similar
~~position of authority to help him or her establish his or her rights by
~~telling him `so-and-so wronged me and has done such and such to me' etc.
~~2. it is permissible to seek somebody's assistance in forbidding evil
~~and helping someone change his or her immoral conduct. one can say to
~~the person who can offer such assistance, `so-and-so does such and such
~~evil deeds. can you exhort him?' etc. this is permissible as long as one
~~intends to forbid evil. if, however, one intends something else apart
~~from this, then this act becomes unlawful. 3. one who seeks legal
~~verdict on a certain matter may point out the defaults of another person
~~or relate something else. one in this case can say to the mufti
~~(religious scholar who issues verdicts): "my father or brother (for
~~example) treated me unjustly. can i get my right established?'' etc.
~~this is permissible to say only if need be, but it is better to say
~~`what do you think of someone who did such and such?' this does not
~~mean, however, that naming the person in question is not permissible,
~~hadith no. 1535 makes this point clear. 4. one who criticizes those who
~~openly commit acts of disobedience, such as drinking wine, gambling,
~~engaging in immoral habits, fornication, hypocrisy, and making mischief.
~~5. it is permissible to call into question the narrators of hadith, and
~~witnesses in the court when the need arises. it is also permissible to
~~mention the bad qualities of somebody for marriage purposes in case an
~~advice is sought. also, if one has noticed that a "seeker of knowledge''
~~frequently goes to the gatherings of an innovator in religion and one
~~fears that this "seeker of knowledge'' may be affected by this so-called
~~scholar, then he must in this case give counsel to the "seeker of
~~knowledge'' by telling him about the "innovator,'' etc. 6. it is
~~permissible to use names such as "al-a`mash'' which means `the blear-
~~eyed' to talk about people who are known by such names for the sake of
~~identification and not for disparaging people and underestimating them.
~~to identify them without resorting to such names is however better.

# عن عائشة رضي الله عنها أن رجلا استأذن على النبي صلى الله عليه و سلم
~~فقال : [ ائذنوا له بئس أخو العشيرة ] متفق عليه . احتج به البخاري في جواز

~~the backbiting of wicked people to save people from being deceived from
~~their appearance. if people are not informed of the real conduct of such

~~do not think that so-and-so understands anything of our faith.'' [al-
~~bukhari] al-bukhari said: al-laith bin sa`d, who is one of the narrators
~~of this hadith, said: the two men mentioned by the prophet (pbuh) in
~~this hadith were hypocrites (i.e., they revealed faith and concealed
~~disbelief). commentary: hypocrites are also people of mischievous and
~~doubtful conduct. it is, therefore, not only permissible but necessary
~~to make people aware of their real position so that people become
~~cautious about them and their religious and worldly life may remain safe
~~from their machinations. PageV01P1942

~~fatimah bint qais (may allah be pleased with her) said: i came to the

~~proposal of marriage.'' the messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "muawiyah is
~~destitute and he has no property, and abul-jahm is very hard on women.''
~~[bukhari and muslim]. commentary: we learn from this hadith that it is
~~permissible to mention the true facts, virtues and vices without
~~equivocation, about the parties who intend to enter into wedlock
~~provided one does it for their welfare. PageV01P1943

# وعن زيد بن أرقم رضي الله عنه قال : خرجنا مع رسول الله صلى الله عليه و
~~سلم في سفر أصاب الناس فيه شدة فقال عبد الله بن أبي : لا تنفقوا على من
~~عند رسول الله حتى ينفضوا وقال : لئن رجعنا إلى المدينة ليخرجن الأعز منها
~~الأذل فأتيت رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم فأخبرته بذلك فأرسل إلى عبد
~~الله بن أبي فاجتهد يمينه ما فعل فقالوا : كذب زيد رسول الله صلى الله عليه
~~و سلم فوقع في نفسي مما قالوه شدة حتى أنزل الله تعالى تصديقي { إذا جاءك
~~المنافقون } ( المنافقين 1 ) ثم دعاهم النبي صلى الله عليه و سلم ليستغفر
~~لهم فلووا رؤوسهم ] متفق عليه 1534. zaid bin al-arqam (may allah be
~~pleased with him) said: we set out on a journey along with the messenger
~~of allah (pbuh) and we faced many hardships. `abdullah bin ubaiy (the
~~chief of the hypocrites at al-madinah) said to his friends: "do not
~~spend on those who are with the messenger of allah (pbuh) until they
~~desert him.'' he also said: "if we return to al-madinah, the more
~~honourable (meaning himself, i.e., abdullah bin ubaiy) will drive out
~~therefrom the meaner (meaning messenger of allah (pbuh)).'' i went to
~~the messenger of allah (pbuh) and informed him about that and he sent
~~someone to `abdullah bin ubaiy. he asked him whether he had said that or
~~not. abdullah took an oath that he had not done anything of that sort
~~and said that it was zaid who carried a false tale to the messenger of
~~allah (pbuh). zaid said: i was so much perturbed because of this until
~~this verse was revealed verifying my statement: "when the hypocrites
~~come to you (o muhammad (pbuh)), they say: `we bear witness that you are
~~indeed the messenger of allah.' allah knows that you are indeed his
~~messenger, and allah bears witness that the hypocrites are liars
~~indeed.'' (63:1) then the messenger of allah (pbuh) called the
~~hypocrites in order to seek forgiveness for them from allah, but they
~~turned away their heads. [al-bukhari and muslim]. commentary: `abdullah
~~bin ubaiy was the chief of the hypocrites at al-madinah. in the journey
~~mentioned in this hadith, which was undertaken in connection with the
~~war with banu al-mustaliq, he had used improper words against the
~~prophet (pbuh) and muslims, which were overheard by zaid bin al-arqam
~~(may allah be pleased with him). the latter informed the prophet (pbuh)
~~about this occurrence. this incident goes to prove that exposing the
~~designs and conspiracies of hypocrites does not form backbiting. in
~~fact, it is essential to keep people informed about them in the interest
~~of islam and muslims. PageV01P1944

# وعن عائشة رضي الله عنها قالت قالت هند امرأة أبي سفيان للنبي صلى الله

~~أخذت منه وهو لا يعلم قال : [ خذي ما يكفيك وولدك بالمعروف ] متفق عليه
~~1535. `aishah (may allah be pleased with her) said: hind, the wife of
~~abu sufyan, said to the prophet (pbuh): abu sufyan is a niggardly man
~~and does not give me and my children adequate provisions for maintenance
~~unless i take something from his possession without his knowledge. the
~~prophet (pbuh) said to her, "take from his possessions on a reasonable
~~basis that much which may suffice for you and your children.'' [al-
~~bukhari and muslim]. commentary: hind was the mother of mu`awiyah (may
~~allah be pleased with him). along with her husband, abu sufyan, she
~~embraced islam in the year of conquest of makkah. we learn from this
~~hadith that: 1. in order to know religious injunctions, husband and wife
~~can mention each other's shortcomings before a mufti (a religious
~~scholar who is in a position to issue verdicts on religious matters). 2.
~~if a husband does not give his wife enough money to cover the domestic
~~expenses, then it is permissible for his wife to take some of his money
~~without his permission, provided the amount thus taken is for essential
~~expenses not for superfluous matters. PageV01P1945

~~about with calumnies will never enter jannah.'' [al-bukhari and muslim].
~~commentary: a person who thinks that talebearing is lawful, and
~~practices it to create conflict and quarrel among people despite the
~~fact that he knows it is unanimously forbidden, will never go to jannah.
~~a person who considers it unlawful but does it out of sheer human
~~weakness, will in the first instance go to hell, if allah does not

~~إحدى روايات البخاري قال العلماء : معنى [ وما يعذبان في كبير ] : أي كبير
~~في زعمهما وقيل : كبير تركه عليهما 1537. ibn `abbas (may allah be pleased
~~with them) said: the messenger of allah (pbuh) passed by two graves and
~~said, "both of them (the persons in these graves) are being tortured,
~~and they are not being tortured for a cardinal sin. but indeed they are
~~great sins. one of them used not to save himself from being soiled with
~~his urine, and the other one used to go about with calumnies (among the
~~people to rouse hostilities, e.g., one goes to a person and tells him
~~that so-and-so says about him such and such evil things).'' [al-bukhari
~~and muslim]. commentary: 1. "la yastatiru min baulihi'' has another
~~meaning, namely: "he does not pass urine in privacy but does it
~~shamelessly in the presence of other people.'' obviously shamelessness
~~is also a sin. talebearing, carelessness in saving oneself from splash
~~of urine drops, and lack of observance of privacy are sins which are
~~liable to punishment. 2. the hadith also proves punishment in the grave.

~~excellent in islam provided they acquire the knowledge and understanding
~~of the religion. you will find the best people in it (islam) those who
~~had a deep hatred (for leadership). you will find the worst among the
~~people a double-faced person who appears to some people with one face
~~and to others with another face.'' [al-bukhari and muslim]. commentary:
~~1. "like ores'' here signifies origin or source which will be a means of
~~honour for them. that is, the tribes which were distinguished for
~~nobility in the pre-islamic period will also be distinguished after
~~embracing islam. there will be no reduction in their prestige and honour
~~provided they attain true understanding of religion and adhere to its
~~teachings. 2. such people who do not have any desire for office and
~~position are most suitable for holding the reins of government. they
~~serve the interest of public better because, being aware to their
~~responsibilities, they honestly endeavour to fulfill the trust reposed
~~in them. they keep the boundaries marked by allah and prefer the
~~interests of the nation and their own country. 3. a "double-faced
~~person'' is one who makes a group believe that he is their supporter and
~~well-wisher, but when he goes to the opposite group, he tries to make
~~them believe that he is entirely with them. the best among people is one

~~`abdullah bin `umar (may allah be pleased with them) replied: "in the
~~days of the messenger of allah (pbuh), we counted this act as an act of
~~hypocrisy.'' [al-bukhari]. commentary: this hadith points out that to
~~praise the rulers in their presence and to condemn them in their absence
~~amounts to practical hypocrisy because what one has in his heart does
~~not find expression in his speech, and what one expresses in his words
~~does not agree with what one has in his heart. the conduct of a true
~~muslim should be that if a ruler is noble, just and pious, he should
~~admire him even in his presence (when there arises a need for it, and
~~not for the sake of flattering him) and he should also praise him in his
~~absence. if the ruler is bad, he should warn him of the evil
~~consequences of his bad conduct to his face, and the same attitude
~~should be maintained when he is not present because this is the well-
~~meaning attitude which has been ordained to every muslim. against this,
~~the attitude of the first kind is a mark of hypocrisy which has been

# 1546. sumurah bin jundub (may allah be pleased with him) said: the
~~messenger of allah (pbuh) very often used to ask his companions, "do any
~~one of you has seen a dream?'' so dreams would be narrated to him by
~~those whom allah willed to relate. one day he (pbuh) said, "last night i
~~had a vision in which two men (angels) came to me and woke me up and
~~said to me, `proceed!' i set out with them and we came across a man
~~lying down, and behold, another man was standing over his head, holding
~~a big rock. behold, he was throwing the rock at the man's head, smashing
~~it. when he struck him, the stone rolled away and he went after it to
~~get it, and no sooner had he returned to this man, his head was healed
~~and restored to its former condition. the thrower (of the rock) then did
~~the same as he had done before. i said to my two companions, `subhan-
~~allah! who are these?' they said: `proceed, proceed.' so we proceeded
~~and came to a man lying in a prone position and another man standing
~~over his head with an iron hook, and behold, he would put the hook in
~~one side of the man's mouth and tear off that side of his face to the
~~back (of the neck), and similarly tear his nose from front to back, and
~~his eyes from front to back. then he turned to the other side of the
~~man's face and did just as he has done with the first side. he had
~~hardly completed that (second) side when the first returned to its
~~normal state. i said to my two companions, `subhan-allah! who are
~~these?' they said, `proceed, proceed.' so we proceeded and came across
~~something like a tannur (a kind of baking oven, a pit usually clay-lined
~~for baking bread).'' i (the narrator) think the prophet (pbuh) said, "in
~~that oven there was much noise and voices.'' the prophet (pbuh) added,
~~"we looked into it and found naked men and women, and behold, a flame of
~~fire was reaching to them from underneath, and when it reached them they
~~cried loudly. i asked, `who are these?' they said to me, `proceed,
~~proceed.' and so we proceeded and came across a river.'' i (the
~~narrator) think he said, "-- red like blood.'' the prophet (pbuh) added,
~~"and behold, in the river there was a man swimming, and on the bank
~~there was a man who had collected many stones. behold, while the other
~~man was swimming, he went near him. the former opened his mouth and the
~~latter (on the bank) threw a stone into his mouth whereupon he went
~~swimming again. then again he (the former) returned to him (the latter),
~~and every time the former returned, he opened his mouth, and the latter
~~threw a stone into his mouth, (and so on) the performance was repeated.
~~i asked my two companions, `who are these?' they replied, `proceed,
~~proceed.' and we proceeded till we came to a man with a repulsive
~~appearance, the most repulsive appearance you ever saw a man having!
~~beside him there was a fire, and he was kindling it and running around
~~it. i asked my two companions, `who is this (man).' they said to me,
~~`proceed, proceed!' so we proceeded till we reached a garden of deep
~~green dense vegetation, having all sorts of spring colours. in the midst
~~of the garden there was a very tall man, and i could hardly see his head
~~because of his great height, and around him there were children in such
~~a large number as i have never seen! i said to my two companions, `who
~~is this?' they replied, `proceed, proceed.' so we proceeded till we came
~~to a majestic, huge garden, greater and better than any garden i have
~~ever seen! my two companions said to me, `ascend up' and i ascended
~~up.'' the prophet (pbuh) added, "so we ascended till we reached a city
~~built of gold and silver bricks, and we went to its gate and asked (the
~~gatekeeper) to open the gate, and it was opened; and we entered the city
~~and found in it men with one side of their bodies as handsome as the
~~most handsome person you have ever seen, and the other side as ugly as
~~the ugliest person you have ever seen! my two companions ordered those
~~men to throw themselves into the river. behold, there was a river
~~flowing across (the city), and its water was like milk in whiteness.
~~those men went and threw themselves in it and then returned to us after
~~the ugliness (of their bodies) had disappeared, and they came in the
~~best shape.'' the prophet (pbuh) further added, "my two companions said
~~to me: `this place is the `adn jannah, and that is your place.' i raised
~~up my sight, and behold, there i saw a palace like a white cloud! my two
~~companions said to me, `that palace is your place,' i said to them, `may
~~allah bless you both! let me enter it.' they replied, `as for now, you
~~will not enter it, but you shall enter it (one day).' i said to them, `i
~~have seen many wonders tonight. what does all that mean which i have
~~seen?' they replied, `we will inform you: as for the first man you came
~~upon, whose head was being smashed with the rock, he is the symbol of
~~the one who studies the qur'an and then neither recites it nor acts on
~~its orders, and sleeps, neglecting the enjoined prayers. as for the man
~~you came upon, whose sides of mouth, nostrils and eyes were torn off
~~from front to back, he is the symbol of the man who goes out of his
~~house in the morning and tells lies that are spread all over the world.
~~and those naked men and women whom you saw in a construction resembling
~~an oven, they are the adulterers and the adulteresses. and the man who
~~was given a stone to swallow is the eater of ar-riba (usury), and the
~~bad-looking man whom you saw near the fire, kindling it and going around
~~it, is malik, the gatekeeper of hell, and the tall man you saw in the
~~garden is (prophet) abraham, and the children around him are those who
~~died upon al-fitrah (the islamic faith of monotheism).''' the narrator
~~added: some muslims asked the prophet (pbuh) , "o messenger of allah!
~~what about the children of al-mushrikun (i.e., polytheists, pagans,
~~idolaters, and disbelievers in the oneness of allah and in his messenger
~~muhammad (pbuh))?'' the prophet (pbuh) replied, "and also the children
~~of al-mushrikun.'' the prophet (pbuh) added: "my two companions added,
~~`the men you saw half handsome and half ugly were these people who had
~~mixed an act that was good with another that was bad, but allah forgave
~~them'.'' another narration of al-bukhari is: the messenger of allah
~~(pbuh) said, "one night two men came to me and took me to a blessed
~~land.'' (the messenger of allah (pbuh) told of the same incident as
~~above) and said, "after a while of walking we came upon a pit like an
~~oven, narrow at the top and wide at the bottom with fire raging in it.
~~when the flames rose up (the people in it) also rose up till they were
~~about to come out; and when the fire subsided they, too, would go down
~~with it. in it were naked men and women.'' (the remainder of the hadith
~~is the same as the above hadith except that at the end of it, the
~~messenger of allah said: "we came upon a river of blood in the middle of
~~which there was a man standing, and at the bank of the river there was a
~~man with plenty of stones before him...'' in this narration we also
~~find: "they made me climb the tree and they made me enter an abode so
~~beautiful the like of which i have never seen before. there (i saw) old
~~men and youth.'' in this narration we also find: "`the first house you
~~entered was the abode of the believers in general, and the other house
~~was the abode of the martyrs. i am jibril (gabriel), and this is
~~mika'il. raise your head.' i looked up and saw something like clouds.
~~they said to me, `that is your abode.' i said, `shall i enter it?' they
~~said, `you have not completed your term of life yet. when you do, you
~~will certainly enter it.''' [al-bukhari] commentary: this hadith has the
~~following points: 1. manifestation through dream of punishment of
~~various evils, i.e., forgetting the qur'an after having memorized it,
~~not practising the teachings of the qur'an, violating the precepts of
~~the qur'an after attaining their knowledge, slackness in offering
~~obligatory salat, lying, immoral acts, usury, etc. strict warnings have
~~been issued against all these evils, and the punishment to which they
~~are liable have been mentioned in this hadith. may allah save us from
~~them. 2. this hadith also mentions the unique status of prophet (pbuh)
~~and the distinguished place of martyrs. 3. we also learn from this
~~hadith that allah has made hell for punishment and jannah for reward.
~~muhammad (pbuh), the last prophet of allah, was made to witness many
~~scenes which demonstrated the retribution and reward of deeds done by
~~people in their earthly life. PageV01P1964

# chapter 261 falsehood that is permissible PageV01P1965
# أعلم أن الكذب وإن كان أصله محرما فيجوز في بعض الأحوال بشروط قد أوضحتها
~~في كتاب : الأذكار ( انظر باب النهي عن الكذب وبيان أقسامه من الأذكار )
~~ومختصر ذلك أن الكلام وسيلة إلى المقاصد . فكل مقصود محمود يمكن تحصيله
~~بغير الكذب يحرم الكذب فيه وإن لم يمكن تحصيله إلا بالكذب جاز الكذب . ثم
~~إن كان تحصيل ذلك المقصود مباحا كان الكذب مباحا وإن كان واجبا كان الكذب
~~واجبا فإذا اختفى مسلم من ظالم يريد قتله أو أخذ ماله وأخفى ماله وسئل
~~إنسان عنه وجب الكذب بإخفائه وكذا لو كان عنده وديعة وأراد ظالم أخذها وجب
~~الكذب بإخفائها والأحوط في هذا كله أن يوري ومعنى التورية : أن يقصد
~~بعبارته مقصودا صحيحا ليس هو كاذبا بالنسبة إليه وإن كان كاذبا في ظاهر
~~اللفظ وبالنسبة إلى ما يفهمه المخاطب ولو ترك التورية وأطلق عبارة الكذب
~~فليس بحرام في هذا الحال . واستدل العلماء بجواز الكذب في هذا الحال بحديث
~~أم كلثوم رضي الله عنها أنها سمعت رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم يقول : [
~~ليس الكذاب الذي يصلح بين الناس فينمي خيرا أو يقول خيرا ] متفق عليه زاد
~~مسلم في رواية : قالت أم كلثوم : ولم أسمعه يرخص في شيء مما يقول الناس إلا
~~في ثلاث . تعني الحرب والإصلاح بين الناس وحديث الرجل امرأته وحديث المرأة
~~زوجها the learned compiler of this book has put forth some arguments to
~~prove that it is lawful to tell a lie under the stress of circumstances.
~~an example of this is the case of a muslim who hides himself or his
~~money from a tyrant who is bent on killing him or taking his money from
~~him. if one knows the whereabouts of this muslim or his money and is
~~asked about it, it is permissible to lie in this case to save a muslim's
~~life or his property, but it is better to give an equivocal answer, that
~~is one which is not clear or definite in meaning, and that can be
~~interpreted in more than one way in order to shun lying altogether. the
~~sum and substance of discussion has been derived from the narration
~~ascribed to umm kulthum (may allah be pleased with her). she said: the
~~messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "a liar is not the one who tries to
~~bring about a reconciliation between the people and speaks good to avert
~~dispute or to convey good.'' [al-bukhari]. it may be concluded that
~~falsehood is permissible in the following three cases: (i) while
~~fighting jihad in the cause of allah. (ii) to conciliate between people.
~~(iii) for the husband to please his wife and the wife to please her
~~husband. PageV01P1966

~~hadith, the word used is "kadhibain'' which means "two liars'' one is
~~that person who tells a lie and attributes his statement to the prophet

~~impression of getting something from my husband which he has not in fact
~~given me?'' the messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "the one who creates a

~~who wears two garments of falsehood.'' [al-bukhari and muslim].
~~commentary: some people disguise themselves as pious to create a false
~~impression of their piety; some put up the appearance of scholars to
~~establish their scholarship; and some take to highly expensive clothes
~~to give the impression of being rich. since these things are fabricated
~~and false, they constitute great sins. one should live as one really is.

~~tormented with it on the day of resurrection. a person is not bound to
~~fulfill a vow about something which he does not possess. cursing a
~~believer is like murdering him.'' [al-bukhari and muslim]. commentary:
~~"he who swears by a religion other than that of islam'' here means
~~either of the two things stated here. for instance, if a person says:
~~"if i do such and such, then i am a christian or a jew.'' now if he
~~really intends to embrace christianity or judaism, he will immediately
~~become so because his intention to be a kafir (disbeliever) is kufr

~~other religions and is intended to express his firm resolution to live
~~as a muslim to the last even then such a vow is undesirable and is a sin

# وعن ابن مسعود رضي الله عنه قال قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم : [
~~ليس المؤمن بالطعان ولا اللعان ولا الفاحش ولا البذي ] رواه الترمذي وقال
~~حديث حسن 1555. ibn mas`ud (may allah be pleased with him) reported: the
~~messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "a true believer is not involved in
~~taunting, or frequently cursing (others) or in indecency or abusing.''
~~[at-tirmidhi]. commentary: this hadith tells us the virtues of a mu'min
~~(true muslim). taunting here means to disgrace someone with reference to
~~his lineage or by means of backbiting and slander. la`in is a person who
~~is given to frequently cursing others, reproaching and using abusive
~~language. (fahish) is one who commits through word or practice
~~immodesty. badhiy is a person with a loose tongue. this word is also
~~used for an impudent and abusive person. this hadith strongly criticizes

# وعن أبي الدرداء رضي الله عنه قال قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم :
~~[ إن العبد إذا لعن شيئا صعدت اللعنة إلى السماء فتغلق أبواب السماء دونها
~~ثم تهبط إلى الأرض فتغلق أبوابها دونها ثم تأخذ يمينا وشمالا فإذا لم تجد
~~مساغا رجعت إلى الذي لعن فإن كان أهلا لذلك وإلا رجعت إلى قائلها ] رواه
~~أبو داود 1556. abud-darda' (may allah be pleased with him) said: the
~~messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "when a person curses somebody or
~~something, the curse goes up to heaven and the gates of heaven get
~~closed. then it comes down to the earth and its gates get closed. then
~~it turns right and left, and if it does not find an entrance to go
~~anywhere, it returns to the person or thing that was cursed; if he or it
~~deserves to be cursed; otherwise it returns to the person who uttered
~~it.'' [abu dawud]. commentary: al-la`nah (curse) means deprivation of
~~allah's mercy. we learn from this hadith that the act of cursing is such
~~that one who does it can become himself a victim of it. one should,
~~therefore, abstain from cursing. PageV01P1981

# وعن أبي برزة نضلة بن عبيد الأسلمي رضي الله عنه قال : بينما جارية على
~~ناقة عليها بعض متاع القوم إذ بصرت بالنبي صلى الله عليه و سلم وتضايق بهم
~~الجبل فقالت : حل اللهم العنها فقال النبي صلى الله عليه و سلم : [ لا
~~تصاحبنا ناقة عليها لعنة ] رواه مسلم قوله [ حل ] بفتح الهاء المهملة

~~ولا إشكال فيه بل المراد النهي أن تصاحبهم تلك الناقة وليس فيه نهي عن
~~بيعها وذبحها وركوبها في غير صحبة النبي صلى الله عليه و سلم بل كل ذلك وما
~~سواه من التصرفات جائز لا منع منه إلا من مصاحبة النبي صلى الله عليه و سلم
~~بها لأن هذه التصرفات كلها كانت جائزة فمنع بعض منها فبقي الباقي على ما
~~كان والله أعلم 1558. abu barzah nadlah bin `ubaid al-aslami (may allah
~~be pleased with him) said: a young woman was riding a she-camel on which
~~there was the luggage of people. suddenly she saw the prophet (pbuh).
~~the pass of the mountain became narrow for her people (because of fear).
~~the young woman said to the she-camel: "go ahead.'' when it did not
~~move, she said, "o allah! curse it.'' the prophet (pbuh) said, "the she-
~~camel that has been cursed should not accompany us.'' [muslim].
~~commentary: some people have taken this hadith to mean that the she-
~~camel cursed by the young woman was abandoned there and it was neither
~~used for transport nor conveyance, as was the practice in the pre-
~~islamic period with she-camels which were let loose for free pasture for
~~the polytheists' false gods, and nothing was allowed to be carried on
~~them. such she-camels were called as "as-sa'ibah'' there is no
~~justification for such interpretation because the she-camel was not set
~~absolutely free like as-sa'ibah. all that was done was that because of
~~the curse, it was considered unworthy of the entourage company of the
~~prophet (pbuh). except for this bar, it was valid for all other
~~purposes. thus, this hadith proves that it is not permissible to
~~associate with people who are given to sins and heresies in religion
~~because they have been cursed. when one is not permitted to keep an
~~animal which has been cursed, how can one possibly keep company with
~~people who commit acts as a result of which they have been cursed.

~~abu hurairah (may allah be pleased with him) said: the messenger of
~~allah (pbuh) said, "when two persons indulge in abusing each other, the
~~beginner will be the sinner so long as the oppressed does not transgress
~~the limits.'' [muslim]. commentary: this hadith tells us that if a
~~muslim abuses another and says unfair things about him and in return the
~~recipient also abuses him and says unfair things to the same extent,
~~then the entire burden of sin of abusing would lie with the person who
~~initiated the quarrel. but if the one who is wronged, exceeds the limits
~~in revenge, then he will also be guilty to the degree of his excess.
~~thus, this hadith shows that although revenge is permissible in islam,
~~it is better to forgive and bear the excess with patience. the reason
~~behind this is that in revenge, one usually exceeds the limits and
~~becomes an aggressor. allah says: "and verily, whosoever shows patience
~~and forgives, that would truly be from the things recommended by
~~allah.'' (42:43). PageV01P1990

~~"give him a beating.'' then some beat him with their hands, some with
~~their shoes, and some with (a folded) piece of cloth. when he left,
~~someone said to him: "may allah disgrace you!'' the prophet (pbuh) said,
~~"do not help satan overcome him by uttering such words.'' [al-bukhari].
~~commentary: we learn from this hadith that imprecation against a sinner
~~helps satan because he is avowed to disgrace and humiliate muslims
~~before allah. when a muslim curses another muslim and imprecates for his
~~humiliation and disgrace, he in fact tries to accomplish the mission of
~~satan because in doing so satan will have achieved his objective.
~~therefore, one should not curse a fellow muslim even if he or she is a
~~sinner. in fact, one should pray to allah for his or her guidance.

~~messenger of allah! these have been drenched by rainfall.'' he remarked,
~~"why did you not place this (the drenched part of the heap) over the

~~commentary: 1. to take arms here signifies to revolt against the muslim
~~community (and a muslim government, for that matter) or draw a sword,
~~gun, etc., to kill a muslim - a common practice in the present-day
~~terrorism. 2. forgery and deceit have two different forms; one is
~~implied and other is physical and visible. in the former, falsehood is
~~given a veneer of truth. the latter is concealment of some defect,
~~adulteration of some inferior quality merchandise in a superior one,
~~addition of something to increase weight or volume or a substance by
~~unfair means and other malpractices. 3. "he is none of us'' means "he is
~~not following the way of muslims'' or "his conduct is unlike that of

~~allure another customer who is interested in the thing. if a person has
~~no intention of purchasing a thing which is being auctioned, one should

~~will be raised higher according to the nature of his breach. behold,
~~there will be no greater a sin with respect to breaking the covenant
~~than that of a ruler who breaks his covenant with the muslim masses.''
~~[muslim]. commentary: this hadith clearly shows that breach of covenant
~~is forbidden in islam, especially on the part of a ruler because (a) he
~~is in a position to honour his covenant, and (b) his evil can affect the
~~whole muslim community. it was a custom in the pre-islamic period of
~~ignorance in arabia to fix flags on poles for those who were guilty of
~~breach of oath to humiliate and defame them. almighty allah has
~~mentioned the punishment of flags on the day of resurrection for such
~~people who break their covenant so that people can easily understand its
~~nature. what a humiliation that will be! * placing the flag by his

~~is not lawful for a muslim to desert (stop talking to) his brother
~~beyond three nights, the one turning one way and the other turning to
~~the other way when they meet, the better of the two is one who is the
~~first to greet the other.'' [al-bukhari and muslim]. commentary: 1.
~~since islam is a religion based on the nature of man, it has a suitable
~~concession in all his natural affairs. when there occurs a dispute
~~between two muslims then unpleasantness and contraction of mind are
~~bound to result from it. in such a situation they naturally do not like
~~to speak or maintain contact with each other. islamic shari`ah has
~~acknowledged the validity of this reaction and granted permission to the
~~party to suspend speech for three days. since longevity of suspension of
~~contact leads to severe hatred and animosity which increases dissension
~~in society, creates obstruction in family relations and injures the bond
~~of friendship, muslims have been ordered not to let this temporary
~~unpleasantness and turbidity go beyond a period of three days. 2. by
~~highlighting the merit of salam (salutation), this hadith has prescribed
~~an easy way for resuming the relations because salam increases mutual
~~love and paves the way for conversation and reconciliation. PageV01P2050

~~will certainly be punished in hell along with other muslims who violate
~~such divine injunctions. after suffering the punishment in hell, he will

~~three days. if three days have passed, he should meet him and greet him;
~~and if other responds to it they will both share the reward; but if he
~~does not respond, he will bear his sin and the one who (has taken the
~~initiative to) greet (the other) will be absolved of the sin of
~~forsaking (one's brother in faith).'' [abu dawud]. commentary: 1.
~~contact and speech with people should be for the pleasure of allah only.
~~for instance, if somebody is a heretic in religion, or commits sins
~~openly, and in spite of the advice given to him, he does not mend his
~~way, a muslim can renounce contact with him for the sake of allah. such
~~renunciation is permissible. in fact, it is desirable so that he may
~~learn a lesson from it and may change himself. but severing contacts
~~merely for worldly grievances is not permissible. 2. after three days,

~~of rupturing contact. PageV01P2055

~~should not hold secret counsel, to the exclusion of the third.'' [al-

~~and i were together in khalid bin `uqbah's house which was situated in
~~the market place. a man came to consult ibn `umar. none besides me was
~~present. ibn `umar called another man in and we became four and said to
~~me and the man he had called: move away a bit because i have heard the
~~messenger of allah (pbuh) saying, "the two people should not hold secret
~~counsel together excluding the third.'' commentary: this hadith teaches
~~us certain etiquettes of society. ibn `umar (may allah be pleased with
~~them) called the fourth person so that he (ibn `umar) could hear the
~~conversation of the man who wanted to speak to him in isolation. he
~~asked the other two to move to a distance so that they could not
~~overhear what the person in question wanted to say to him. thus, we
~~learn that in the presence of more than one person, two can speak to
~~each other in confidence. if there are four people, three of them are
~~not permitted to speak in confidence leaving the fourth alone. moreover,
~~this prohibition is for lawful matters only because in unlawful matters
~~such private conversation is altogether forbidden, even if there is no
~~third person. the noble qur'an ordains: "o you who believe! when you
~~hold secret counsel, do it not for sin and wrong and disobedience to the

~~charged on the produce yielded by land which is in the possession of
~~non-muslims in a muslim state, while the revenue that is recovered from
~~the muslims on the lands held by them is called "al-ushr''. "jizyah'' is
~~that annual fee which is charged from the non-muslims for the safety and
~~security provided to their life, property and honour by a muslim state.
~~muslims pay zakat and non-muslims pay jizyah. 2. "adhab'' torment is
~~that particular punishment which allah will inflict upon the inhabitants
~~of hell. if anyone gives a similar punishment to anybody in this world,
~~he will be punished by allah in the hereafter for it, because he does
~~not like anyone to do so. to make someone stand in a sizzling hot day

# وعن ابن مسعود رضي الله عنه قال : لعن رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم
~~آكل الربا وموكله . رواه مسلم زاد الترمذي وغيره : وشاهديه وكاتبه 1615.
~~`abdullah bin mas`ud (may allah be pleased with him) reported: the
~~messenger of allah (pbuh) cursed the one who accepts ar-riba (the usury)
~~and the one who pays it. [muslim]. the narration in at-tirmidhi adds:
~~and the one who records it, and the two persons who stand witness to it.
~~commentary: both the parties, that is the one who charges interest and
~~the one who pays it, are equally guilty in the matter of usury (or
~~riba). this hadith highlights the intensity of unlawfulness of ar-riba,
~~or what has come to be called nowadays interest which can be judged from
~~the fact that not only the person who charges it and the one who pays it
~~are cursed but even those who write the documents and bear witness to
~~the transaction are condemned although the latter two have no active
~~part in the deal. they have been condemned for their mere co-operation
~~in the matter of interest. thus, we learn that even co-operation in the
~~deal in which interest is involved is an invitation to the curse and
~~wrath of allah. the reason for such severity in the matter of interest
~~is that islam wants to create a society which is founded on fraternity,
~~sympathy, selflessness and sacrifice. if someone is in need of money,
~~the rich should fulfill his needs for the sake of allah's pleasure or
~~give him a loan without interest. as against the islamic system, this
~~system of interest is based on selfishness, exploitation and
~~suppression. in the interest-ridden societies, the affluent ones are not
~~inclined to co-operate with the needy for the sake of allah. all they
~~are concerned with is their own interest. their lust and greed are not
~~reduced in the slightest measure even after draining the last drop of
~~the blood of the poor. this is the reason why shari`ah has forbidden
~~interest of every kind and regarded it unlawful, no matter whether the
~~loan is for the personal need or commercial requirements. some people
~~say that there did not exist any practice of commercial loan in arabia
~~at that time and people used to borrow money for their personal needs
~~only. on the basis of this plea, they say that the interest which has
~~been forbidden by islam relates to the latter form. for this reason,
~~they hold that interest lawful which is charged on loan taken for
~~industry and commerce. they contend that since the borrowers in
~~industrial and commercial sectors make huge profits from such loans, how
~~does it become unlawful if they pay the lender a small fixed annual
~~amount against it? in their opinion, it is a right of the lender which
~~should be paid to him on his wealth. but such arguments are totally
~~wrong for two major reasons: first, the assumption that there was no
~~practice of commercial loans in arabia is altogether baseless.
~~commercial loan was certainly in vogue in the arab society and there is
~~no point in debating this fact. second, nobody can say with certainty
~~that the amount invested by a person in business will yield profit
~~without fail because we see it every day that sometimes huge investments
~~made in business and industry result in colossal loss, but the lending
~~agency does not bother about it at all and it recovers from the borrower
~~every penny of his loan and interest. is this not the height of tyranny
~~and selfishness? if it is supposed that there is no loss, even then the
~~interest on loan substantially contributes to the increase in prices of
~~goods. whatever interest an industrialist pays on loan is added to the
~~cost of his goods, which ultimately increases their prices and in turn
~~adversely affects the purchasing capacity of the customers - the masses.
~~this is the reason why islam has closed this largest source of
~~exploitation, suppression and tyranny by declaring every kind of
~~interest unlawful. it is very sad indeed that in emulating the western
~~societies, muslims have also founded their economy on the system of
~~interest. the westernized rulers of the muslim countries are not making
~~any effort to emancipate their countries from this curse, nor do the
~~people of these countries now have any passion to save themselves from
~~it. in fact, a large majority of them borrow and lend money on interest
~~through the bank without any regard to the islamic injunctions in this
~~respect. given below are some points for the consideration of those
~~muslims who want to protect their faith and religion and save themselves
~~from the curse of interest. the word used for interest in the qur'an is
~~ar-riba which means excess. in shari`ah, it is the measure of excess in
~~one thing when two things are exchanged in some bargain; or in the case
~~of a loan, an increased amount of the loan at the time of its payment.
~~ar-riba is of two kinds: first, riba al-fadl: to take more in exchange
~~of one commodity in the event of barter of two similar commodities.
~~second, riba an-nasi'ah: to take a larger return of one thing while two
~~identical things are bartered. but in this case the larger return is
~~effected after a fixed period of time. in islamic jurisprudence, assets
~~are of two types. one type is of commodities and the other is of the
~~mode of price for exchanging commodities called thaman then every type
~~has a class of varieties. for example, food grains are a type of assets
~~and rice, wheat, etc., are its varieties. similarly, silver, gold, etc.,
~~are varieties of the second type of assets. coins, currency notes,
~~company shares, etc., can also be considered varieties of this type in
~~contemporary life. this hadith has injunctions in respect of both types
~~of assets. six things mentioned in the hadith are gold, silver, wheat,
~~barley, dates and salt. some religious scholars have restricted the
~~matters relating to interest to these six things only and do not regard
~~increase or decrease in other things as usury, while going by analogy
~~the majority of scholars and jurists have included other things also in
~~this list. (for instance, all the food grains whether they are
~~calculated in terms of weight or measure, or which have - like gold and
~~silver - the quality of being thaman, or according to some scholars and
~~jurists which are capable of being stored). thus, to sum up, these two
~~types of assets have four varieties: 1. commodities which are sold by
~~weight. 2. commodities which are sold by measure. 3. commodities which
~~can be stored. 4. commodities which are used as thaman in sale and
~~purchase. in all such matters the position of interest-bearing and
~~interest-free things would be as under: 1. when commodities to be
~~exchanged are of the same `type' and `variety,' any increase or decrease
~~in them will be unlawful, as will be their sale on credit; for example,
~~exchange of wheat with wheat and rice with rice. it is essential that
~~these things are equal in measure and/or weight, and are in actual
~~possession. 2. if two things to be exchanged are of the same `type' but
~~of a different `variety,' any increase or decrease in them is
~~permissible. their sale on credit is, however, not lawful. for instance,
~~the exchange of one kilogram of silver with two grams of gold, or the
~~barter of one kilo barley with half a kilo wheat, or the exchange of one
~~dinar with four riyals. if such a bargain is on cash basis it will be
~~fair, but any credit in this case is not correct. 3. when the two things
~~to be exchanged are not of the same `type' and are also different in
~~`variety,' then any increase or decrease in them is permissible and
~~their sale on credit is also allowed. for example, exchange of one
~~kilogramme of wheat with a gram of gold, bargain of one kilogramme of
~~dates with ten tola (about 116 grams) silver. any increase or decrease
~~in them is permissible, as is their sale on credit PageV01P2085

~~him) when ibn umm maktum (may allah be pleased with him) (who was blind)
~~came to visit him. (this incident took place after the order of hijab).
~~the prophet (pbuh) told us to hide ourselves from him (i.e., observe
~~hijab). we said: "o messenger of allah (pbuh), he is blind and is unable
~~to see us, nor does he know us.'' he replied; "are you also blind and
~~unable to see him?'' [abu dawud and at-tirmidhi]. commentary: one of the

~~`iddah (probation observed on divorce or death of the husband) in the

~~women (uncovered or simply to mix with them in seclusion).'' a man from
~~the ansar said, "tell me about the brother of a woman's husband.'' he
~~replied, "the brother of a woman's husband is death.'' [al-bukhari and
~~muslim]. commentary: this hadith tells us an extremely important point
~~in respect of the veil about which the majority of muslims are unaware
~~or negligent. the point that it tells us that a woman must observe the
~~veil from the real brothers, cousins etc., of her husband because their
~~visits in her home are very frequent and there may occur several
~~occasions when they come across each other alone. for this reason, there
~~are greater chances of mischief with them. this explains why the
~~husband's male relatives have been regarded as "death'', that is from
~~the religious point of view they are fatal. in other words, if they
~~commit the mischief, it will prove fatal because in an islamic state
~~this crime is punishable by rajm (stoning to death). this can also be
~~fatal in another way. if the husband begins to suspect that his wife has
~~illicit relations with someone else, he might kill her or divorce her
~~out of his sense of honour. even in case of divorce, her life will
~~become desolate. another meaning of it can be that one should be as much
~~afraid of meeting such women in seclusion with whom any kind of contact
~~is not permissible as one is afraid of death. when a woman is required
~~to observe the veil from the real brothers of her husband, why would it
~~not be essential to observe the veil from the husband's friends.
~~slackness in this matter is also very common nowadays. although the
~~dangerous consequences of this fashion come to our notice everyday
~~through newspapers, people do not learn any lesson from them, and the
~~fashion of non-observance of the veil is spreading fast like an
~~epidemic. may allah save us from this evil! PageV01P2105

~~allah) for those who remain at home (i.e., those who do not go to the
~~battlefield to fight jihad) is like the sanctity of their own mothers.
~~anyone who remains behind to look after the family of a mujahid and
~~betrays his trust, will be made to stand on the day of resurrection
~~before the mujahid who will take away from his meritorious deeds
~~whatever he likes till he is satisfied.'' the messenger of allah (pbuh)
~~turned toward us and said, "now, what do you think (i.e., will he leave

~~supervision of the families of those mujahidun who go to jihad, is an
~~act of high merit, and if someone violates the trust reposed in him, he
~~will be committing a grave sin indeed. such breach of trust shakes the
~~very structure of mutual cooperation which has a singular importance in
~~islam. this hadith considers the act of those who violate the

~~commentary: this hadith has the following three important points: 1. it

~~their charms, which is the habit of immoral women. such women also adorn
~~their hair in different styles and lure men with their coquetry and

~~after this day.'' he said, "bring all of my nephews to me.'' we were
~~accordingly brought as if we were chickens. then he said, "call for me a
~~barber.'' he directed him to shave our heads which he did. [abu dawud].
~~commentary: ja`far was the cousin of the prophet (pbuh) and he was
~~martyred in the battle of mu'tah. although martyrdom is an honour but
~~even then the bereaved family does feel the shock of the loss. for this
~~reason, the prophet (pbuh) permitted them to give vent to their grief
~~for three days. it should not, however, be taken to mean that he allowed
~~them to lament and wail, because that is prohibited. what he actually
~~allowed them was the natural weeping which does occur when people come
~~for condolence and speak of the deceased. such expression of grief is
~~permissible after a period of three days also. therefore, what the
~~prophet (pbuh) had advised them was not in the nature of unlawful but
~~natural. the children of the deceased called themselves "chickens'' as
~~they were greatly enervated by the tragedy. this hadith has been
~~mentioned here to confirm the validity of shaving the hair of the head,

~~who practises al-washm al-washm was performed (in the past) by piercing
~~needle in some part of the body for drawing blood and then filling the
~~cavity caused by it with antimony, indigo, etc., to make the spot green
~~or black. this is called tattooing. in the arab society of the prophet's
~~time, this fashion was very popular among women for enhancing their
~~charms and beauty in the same way as the fashion of patching someone's
~~hair with his own. al-mustaushima is a woman who asks some women for
~~tattooing and/or a woman who marks tattoos on the skin of another woman.
~~as this act amounts to changing the natural appearance of a person, both
~~women, that is the one who subjects her body to tattooing and the one
~~who makes this operation, are cursed. such fashions are in vogue in this
~~age also. plucking the eyelashes and filling them with colours and other
~~material of make up, or like hindu women, making mark between the
~~eyebrows with cinnabar etc., fall in the category of such fashions. such
~~means of make up which are practised nowadays by women and on which huge
~~amounts of money are wasted are the things which have been cursed.
~~muslim women should, therefore, avoid such evils as they are ruinous for
~~religion as well as worldly life. similar is the case of nail polish. in
~~the opinion of some religious scholars, this act invalidates wudu'.
~~women are now also in the habit of keeping long nails on which nail
~~polish is applied to give an effect of beastly claws. all such vile
~~fashions have been borrowed by oriental societies from the class of
~~shameless women of the west, and muslim women have also adopted them. we
~~must strictly abstain from them because they tend to create resemblance
~~to the non-muslims, which is unlawful and is rated as a major sin.

~~tattooed, and those women who get their hair removed from their eyebrows
~~and faces (except the beard and the mustache), and those who make

~~teeth), at-tafalluj (to create gaps between the teeth), an-nams (the

~~soothsayers. he (pbuh) said, "they are of no account.'' upon this they
~~said to him, "o messenger of allah! but they sometimes make true
~~predictions.'' thereupon the messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "that is a
~~word pertaining to truth which a jinn snatches (from the angels) and
~~whispers into the ears of his friend (the soothsayers) who will then mix
~~more than a hundred lies with it.'' [al-bukhari and muslim]. the
~~narration in al-bukhari is: "the angels descend in the clouds and
~~mention matters which has been decreed in heaven; satan steals a hearing
~~(listens to it stealthily) and communicates it to the soothsayers who
~~tell along with it a hundred lies.'' commentary: kahin (soothsayer),
~~munajjim (astrologer) and arraf (foreteller) have similar
~~characteristics but with a slight difference. all of them make
~~predictions about the future. kahin would overhear some jinn and
~~disclose the secret to people which would sometimes prove true, because
~~the jinn's source of information was satan who sometimes stole away some
~~information from the angels. but after the annunciation of the prophet
~~(pbuh) it was made impossible for jinns and satans to overhear anything
~~in the skies. moreover, kahin and others of his ilk would make
~~predictions on the basis of certain signs and circumstantial evidence
~~which could go wrong or right. this is so even to this day. astrological
~~prediction is also a form of foretelling but this is often wrong.
~~al-`irafah, or what is known to be as divination is also an indication
~~of some future occurrence on the basis of certain causes and events. all
~~the three occult arts supplement each other and also take the help of
~~similar other things. in other words, these are all different forms of
~~soothsaying. geomancy also tries to tell about the invisible future. at-
~~tarq is the art of taking omen by striking birds with gravel on their
~~wings or by throwing barley, etc., before them. in the latter formula,
~~if a bird flies towards the right side, it would be a good omen; and if
~~it goes towards the left it will be a bad one. all such things are
~~unlawful and have been strictly forbidden by islam. if anything
~~predicted by these means comes by chance true, it does not furnish any
~~justification for their validity. PageV01P2159

# وعن قبيصة بن المخارق رضي الله عنه قال سمعت رسول الله صلى الله عليه و
~~سلم يقول : [ العيافة والطيرة والطرق من الجبت ] رواه أبو داود بإسناد حسن
~~وقال : الطرق هو : الزجر أي زجر الطير وهو أن يتيمن أو يتشاءم بطيرانه فإن
~~طار إلى جهة اليمين تيمن وإن طار إلى جهة اليسار تشاءم قال أبو داود [
~~العيافة ] : الخط قال الجوهري في الصحاح : الجبت : كلمة تقع على الصنم
~~والكاهن والساحر ونحو ذلك 1670. qabisah bin al-mukhariq (may allah be
~~pleased with him) said: i heard the messenger of allah (pbuh) saying,
~~"the practice of `iyafah, the interpretation of omens from the flight of
~~birds, the practice of divination by drawing lines on the ground and
~~taking evil omens are all practices of al-jibt (the idol, the diviner,
~~or sorcerer).'' [abu dawud]. commentary: iyafah is an occult practice in
~~which the practitioner rapidly draws lines on the soft ground in the
~~presence of his client in such a manner that the lines cannot be counted
~~then he effaces the lines in pairs. if at the end of the exercise two
~~lines are left on the ground, it is taken as a good omen; if it is a
~~single line, it is a bad omen. some people have also described certain
~~other forms of this occult formula. in any case, it was one of the
~~formulas practised by the soothsayers of the period of ignorance. this
~~practice, like others of this kind, was prohibited and muslims were made
~~to understand that such things could neither benefit nor harm anyone,
~~and were mere tricks and frauds; and any reliance on them was absolute
~~superstition and heresy. how sad it is that a large number of muslims of
~~the present age have faith in such occult practices and believe in
~~superstitions. may allah grant us guidance and save us from such evils.
~~al-jibt covers a wide meanings. it means anything worshipped other than
~~the true god (allah), i.e., all false deities, be they an idol, satan,
~~graves, stars, angels, saints, jesus the son of mary, etc. PageV01P2161

~~knowledge of astrology, learns a branch of magic (of which he acquires
~~more as long as) he continues to do so.'' [abu dawud]. commentary: in
~~this hadith, astrology has been regarded a part of magic. in islam the
~~learning of magic has been held equivalent to infidelity. thus, it is
~~evident that in islam, astrology and soothsaying are highly dangerous,
~~and learning them is a great sin. astrology here stands for that pseudo-
~~science on the basis of which future events are predicted with reference
~~to the movements of stars. there is another science called astronomy by

~~of science, however, is a genuine science because it is based on

~~pleased with him) reported: i said: "o messenger of allah, i have
~~recently emerged from ignorance and allah has favoured me with islam.
~~there are still some men among us who visit the soothsayers to consult
~~them (on matters relating to the future).'' he (pbuh) replied, "do not
~~visit them.'' i said: "there are some men who are guided by omens.'' he
~~replied, "these are the ideas which come up in their minds but you
~~should not be influenced by them (i.e., these things) should not prevent
~~them from pursuing their works.'' i said: "there are some men who
~~practise divination by drawing lines on the ground.'' the messenger of
~~allah (pbuh) replied, "there was a prophet who drew lines, the line
~~which agrees with the line drawn by that prophet would be correct.''
~~[muslim]. commentary: 1. this hadith has already appeared earlier
~~[hadith no 701]. "these are the ideas which come up in their minds''
~~means that sometimes something appears and one's mind at once takes it
~~as a bad omen. this is something instinctive and natural and one is not
~~accountable for it. but if one acts in accordance with that omen then
~~what he does is wrong and is, therefore, forbidden. for this reason, the
~~prophet (pbuh) said, "(i.e., these things) should not prevent them from
~~pursuing their works.'' 2. the drawing of a line mentioned in this
~~hadith is different from the drawing of lines in `iyafah mentioned
~~earlier. moreover, that was an act of a prophet which was done by him in
~~the light of wahy sent to him by allah and, therefore, was certainly
~~correct. but now, nobody possesses that knowledge and cannot, therefore,
~~be adopted. the statement of the prophet (pbuh) that: "the line which
~~agrees with the line drawn by that prophet would be correct'' was by way
~~of elucidation. it does not mean that that act can also be done by
~~anyone today, for how can it be done without knowing its principles. how
~~did that prophet of allah draw that line? what were its principles?
~~since that knowledge has passed away with that prophet, it is now no
~~longer valid, nor would it be fruitful. who was the prophet who did it?
~~some people say it was prophet daniyal (daniel), while other think it
~~was prophet idris. allah alone knows the truth. PageV01P2163

~~al-badri (may allah be pleased with him) said: the messenger of allah
~~(pbuh) prohibited the price of a dog, the earning of an prostitute, and
~~the money given to a soothsayer. [al-bukhari and muslim]. commentary: 1.
~~"prohibition of the price of dog'' signifies that the sale and purchase
~~of dogs is forbidden. this a general order which applies to dog of every
~~kind, whether it is for hunting or protection of farms (which is
~~permissible) or is a tamed one. the reason being that dog is an
~~absolutely unclean animal no matter what breed it is. some `ulama' are
~~of the opinion that the sale and purchase of such dog which one intends
~~to keep for lawful needs such as hunting and protecting farms is
~~permissible. so far as reasoning is concerned, the views of the majority
~~of `ulama' are quite strong because we find absolute prohibition of dogs
~~in this hadith. the earning of a vile woman has been called `dower' in
~~the hadith because of its evident form, otherwise it is unlawful and
~~nobody accepts its justification. similar is the case of soothsayers,
~~astrologers, fortunetellers and all those who fool people by telling
~~them about future and thus swindle money from them. their income is also
~~unlawful. 2. it is also unlawful to make any payment to such swindlers

# وعن أنس رضي الله عنه قال قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم : [ لا

~~متفق عليه. anas (may allah be pleased with him) said: the messenger of

~~another and no evil omen, but i am pleased with good omens.'' he was
~~asked: "what is good omen?'' he replied, "a good word.'' [al-bukhari and
~~muslim]. commentary: 1. the phrase "not the transmission of disease of
~~one person to another'' either negates the idea that disease can travel
~~from one person to another or it signifies that one should not attribute
~~the illness of one person to the illness of another. the right approach
~~is that one should think that a person falls ill with the will of allah.
~~this does not mean that this hadith denies the infectious character of
~~certain diseases but it attempts to correct one's belief, namely that if
~~allah wills something, it will certainly occur. thus, this hadith proves
~~that even in infectious diseases it is not the disease itself which is
~~the real cause but the preordainment and will of allah. 2. similar is
~~the case of bad omens. these have no significance at all. if any
~~suspicion crosses one's mind by seeing something, he should neither
~~attach any importance to it nor act what the suspicion demands. good
~~omen is permissible for the reason that it inclines one to associate
~~good hopes with allah, which is a highly commendable tendency. thus, it
~~also induces one to always utter something nice and to listen to what is
~~nice so that in both cases it occasions good omens. one should always
~~abstain from saying what is repulsive to the listeners and tends to be a
~~bad omen. PageV01P2167

~~messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "there is no infection and no evil omen;
~~but if there is anything (that may be a source of trouble) then it could
~~be a house, a horse, and a woman.'' [al-bukhari and muslim]. commentary:
~~this hadith means that nothing is ominous by itself. it is, however,
~~true that because of their certain characteristics, certain things
~~become ominous (troublesome) for certain persons. for example, if one
~~has a small house or bad neighbours, he does not feel happy and peaceful
~~in it. if one's wife is sterile or rude or abusive or immoral, etc.,
~~such a woman is ominous for him, that is, she is a source of trouble and
~~tension rather than that of happiness for him. if one has a horse which
~~is not used for jihad, or is so ill-natured that it neither goes well
~~ordinarily or with whipping, nor does it behave when left to its own
~~will, then it has an ominousness in the sense that it does not serve the

~~good things; you alone avert evil things, and there is no might or power
~~but in you).''' [abu dawud with sahih isnad]. commentary: 1. tiyarah
~~means taking omen. this applies to good as well as bad omens. muslims
~~are required to take good omen only. for this reason, when a muslim
~~resolves to do something good then a bad omen should not impede his way
~~because he believes that it is allah alone who brings about every thing.

~~things from which people usually take a bad omen create suspicions in
~~one's mind, then it is mustahabb (desirable) to recite the prayer

~~عليه وفي رواية لمسلم : [ من اقتنى كلبا ليس بكلب صيد ولا ماشية ولا أرض
~~فإنه ينقص من أجره قيراطان كل يوم ] 1689. abu hurairah (may allah be
~~pleased with him) said: the messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "he who
~~keeps a dog, will lose out of his good deeds equal to one qirat every
~~day, except one who keeps it for guarding the fields or the herd.'' [al-
~~bukhari and muslim]. in a narration of muslim, the messenger of allah
~~(pbuh) is reported to have said: "he who keeps a dog for any reason
~~other than to guard his property (lands) or his flock of sheep, his good
~~deeds equal to two qirat will be deducted every day.'' commentary: 1. we
~~learn from these ahadith that it is permissible to keep dogs for hunting
~~and security of herds and farms but not for any other purpose. if anyone
~~does so, he will be losing a qirat or two from his rewards everyday. why
~~did the prophet (pbuh) use the words qirat or two qirat? some scholars
~~say that at first the prophet (pbuh) said one and subsequently increased
~~the number. some scholars hold that the difference of one and two
~~relates to urban and rural areas. the inhabitants of cities would be
~~losing two qirat from their rewards daily, while in case of villagers
~~this loss will be one qirat only, because they stand in greater need of
~~dogs. 2. why does the reduction in reward take place? in response to
~~this question, it has been stated that it is very difficult to escape
~~from the filth of dogs and sometimes it adversely effects even salat and
~~reduces their reward. some scholars say that since dogs are apt to bark
~~on guests and beggars and scare them, the tension caused by this affects
~~the reward of the host. allah alone knows the truth of the matter. what
~~is qirat? it is differently interpreted. there is a qirat which is
~~mentioned in the funeral prayer. this is equal to the uhud mountain.
~~does it signify the same here? some scholars answer this question in the
~~affirmative while others hold that in the funeral prayer it occurs with
~~reference to allah's mercy and grace but here it relates to his wrath.
~~as the former is far greater than the latter, the word cannot have the
~~same significance in both contexts. PageV01P2184

~~(unlawful), that is for eatables which are forbidden or which have an
~~unpleasant and disgusting smell. garlic, onion etc., are khabith in
~~their raw form and muslims have been prohibited from going to the mosque
~~after eating them. one can, however, eat them in their cooked form. one

~~[some `ulama' are of the opinion that the words of the prophet (pbuh)

~~الغموس ] رواه البخاري وفي رواية له : أن أعرابيا جاء إلى النبي صلى الله

~~: ثم ماذا ؟ قال : [ اليمين الغموس ] قلت : وما اليمين الغموس ؟ قال : [
~~الذي يقتطع مال امرئ مسلم ] : يعني بيمين هو فيها كاذب 1714. `abdullah bin
~~`amr bin al-as (may allah be pleased with them) said: the prophet (pbuh)
~~said, "of the major sins are: associating anything in worship with
~~allah, disobedience to the parents, killing without justification and
~~taking a false oath (intentionally).'' [al-bukhari]. another narration
~~is: a bedouin came to the prophet (pbuh) and asked him: "o messenger of
~~allah, what are the cardinal sins?'' he (pbuh) replied, "associating
~~anything with allah in worship.'' the man asked: "(what is) next?'' the
~~messenger of allah (pbuh) replied, "al-yamin al-ghamus.'' he asked:
~~"what do you mean by al-yamin al-ghamus?'' the messenger of allah (pbuh)
~~replied, "swearing falsely to usurp the property of a muslim.''
~~commentary: "ghamus'' means to drown. a false oath drowns one in sin.
~~for this reason, it is called al-yamin al-ghumus, the oath that drowns
~~one in sin. is it open to expiation? some religious scholars believe
~~that it is, while others think it is not, because in their opinion it is
~~a lie which is employed to deprive somebody of his wealth and property.
~~for this reason, they say that in such case one should beg pardon from
~~allah and arrange to restore the wealth and property to the victim. this
~~seems to be the more appropriate course for it because mere repentance
~~cannot remit this sin. it is necessary to rectify the wrong and
~~compensate the victim. PageV01P2218

~~1718. abu hurairah (may allah be pleased with him) said: the messenger
~~of allah (pbuh) said, "persistence in respect of his oath about his
~~family is more sinful with allah than the payment of its expiation
~~prescribed by allah.'' [al-bukhari and muslim]. commentary: 1. "ahl''
~~means wife, children and other members of one's family. for example, if
~~a man takes an oath regarding some matter relating to his wife, although
~~the act he has forbidden himself is better for him, it will be sinful to
~~stick to the oath. far less than this sin would be the breaking of the
~~oath to normalize his relation with his wife and children. the essence
~~of all these ahadith is that if one comes to realize that, after taking
~~an oath, his oath was wrong, then he must break the oath and do what he
~~had vowed not to do. there are different forms of breaking the oaths.
~~for instance, if one has taken an oath that he will drink alcohol, it
~~will be obligatory for him to break his oath. or if one takes an oath to
~~not to do a thing which is desirable, or taken an oath to do something
~~which is not desirable, then it will be desirable to break the oath.
~~similarly, if one takes an oath to not to do something permissible then
~~the act of breaking the oath will also come in the category of
~~permissible. 2. the expiation of an oath is necessary. this can be done
~~by means of feeding ten poor persons, or by providing clothes to a
~~similar number of persons, or by setting a slave free. if one does not
~~have the capacity to do any of the three acts, then he should observe
~~fast for three days.. 3. if, in spite of realizing that the act one has
~~vowed not to do is better, one still sticks to his oath, he would be
~~then more sinful. 4. the teachings and practices of the prophet (pbuh)
~~tell us that to adopt the better course is preferable to sticking to the
~~oath. PageV01P2223

# وعن عائشة رضي الله عنها قالت أنزلت هذه الآية : { لا يؤاخذكم الله

~~1719. `aishah (may allah be pleased with her) reported: the ayah: "allah
~~will not punish you for what is unintentional in your oaths ...'' was
~~revealed in respect of those persons who are in the habit of repeating:
~~`no, by allah'; and `yes, by allah.' [al-bukhari]. commentary: 1. from
~~the previous as well as present chapter we learn that there are three
~~kinds of oaths: first, false oath (al-yamin al-ghamus). second, absurd
~~(laghw) oath, which is neither sinful nor is there any expiation for its
~~violation. third, al-mu`aqqadah. it is an oath which one takes
~~wholeheartedly for doing or not doing anything. it is liable for
~~expiation if one violates it. its expiation is mentioned in this hadith.
~~2. what will be the quantity of the average food that is to be served to
~~the ten person by way of expiation? we do not find any elaboration of
~~this in any hadith. some `ulama' have stated that it means meals of the
~~day and night. some scholars have taken support of a hadith and
~~suggested that it should be one mudd (about half kilogram) per head
~~because this is the quantity which the prophet (pbuh) prescribed as
~~expiation for sexual intercourse with one's wife during fasting. the
~~expiation prescribed by him was 15 sa` dates which were to be divided
~~among sixty poor fellows. since one sa` consists of four mudd, the
~~quantity of food, without curry, for ten persons would be six kilograms.
~~(ibn kathir). this means that it would be six kilograms of flour, or
~~rice, or dates etc. thus, even if ten poor persons are served with an
~~average meal, it would be a substantial quantity. allah alone knows what
~~is correct. PageV01P2226

~~to speak repeatedly in an artificial manner. mutashaddiqun (loud-
~~mouthed) is the plural of mutashaddiq, which means a person who speaks
~~loudly to display his eloquence. mutafaihiqun is the plural of
~~mutafaihiq which is from the word fihq, meaning to fill. this hadith is
~~a reference to those people who speak in a loud and lofty manner. all

~~all his activities of the day will end at `isha', which is the most

~~more so at this particular time (i.e., after `isha' prayer). imam an-
~~nawawi's contention that things like academic discussion, talking to a
~~guest, discussing the lives of the pious etc., are not only permissible
~~but desirable, is also subject to the condition that such an activity
~~does not involve the risk of losing the fajr prayer. if one spends so

# عن أبي هريرة رضي الله عنه عن النبي صلى الله عليه و سلم قال : [ إذا

~~allah be pleased with him) said: the prophet (pbuh) said, "when the
~~iqamah is called, no prayer should be performed except the obligatory
~~prayer.'' [muslim]. commentary: when the iqamah has been announced
~~(prescribed recitation at the commencement of salat when offered in
~~congregation, after the worshippers have taken up that position), it is
~~not permissible to offer any other prayer - whether it is sunnah or
~~nafl. if a person has already started any, he should break it to join
~~the congregation. he should offer the salat which he terminated after
~~the obligatory salat offered in congregation. it is against this hadith
~~to continue nafl salat or sunnah when the worshippers have taken the
~~position to offer salat in congregation and iqamah has been called. some
~~scholars are of the opinion that one can continue the performance of
~~fajr sunnah, even after the congregational salat has started. they have
~~taken the plea that if there is no risk of losing the first rak`ah, it
~~is permissible to continue the sunnah of fajr prayer. their plea is
~~against the present hadith. it is a common feature to see the
~~worshippers offering sunnah during the course of fajr prayer offered in
~~congregation. thus in practice, the sunnah of the fajr prayer are
~~continued regardless of this stipulation. in any case, this practice is
~~totally against the injunctions contained in this hadith. PageV01P2294

~~in certain matters the prophet (pbuh) had some specific injunctions
~~which were obligatory for him but not for his ummah. such things were
~~permissible for him but not for his followers. all these things are
~~called his special distinctions. it is not permissible for muslims to
~~follow such practices. one of these things is saum al-wisal, which means
~~to observe fast for several days at a stretch without taking any food.
~~since allah had granted him special power and patience, he could observe
~~fast continuously for days. as his followers are not endowed with that
~~energy and patience, they are not permitted to do so. 2. "i am not like
~~you'' does not mean that "i am not a man like you,'' because such an
~~interpretation goes against a categorical statement of the qur'an to the
~~effect that "i am a man like you''. what the statement "i am not like
~~you'' really means is "you do not possess that special power which has
~~been granted to me.'' 3. "i am given to eat and to drink'' signifies

~~commentary: we learn the following points from this hadith: 1. the
~~construction of permanent graves is sheer extravagance because they do
~~not benefit the dead. this act is `disliked' and reaches the level of
~~prohibition when graves are ornamented and embellished. 2. sitting on
~~the graves is a disliked act, as has been made clear in the previous

~~address in which he said, "indeed what destroyed the people before you

~~the messenger of allah (pbuh) gave orders to have that woman's hand cut
~~off. commentary: 1. hadd is the punishment fixed by shari`ah and which
~~no one has the authority to increase or decrease. for instance, theft is
~~punishable by the cutting of the hand; the punishment of adultery is a
~~hundred stripes or rajm (stoning to death); the punishment of drinking
~~of intoxicants is forty stripes etc. 2. nobody has the right to
~~intercede or make any recommendation in this matter. 3. there is no
~~distinction of male or female in the matter of these punishments
~~(hudud). whoever commits a crime which is punishable by hadd, whether
~~that person is male or female, will be liable for punishment prescribed
~~under hadd - the punishment, the limits of which have been defined in
~~the qur'an and hadith. 4. no one is exempted from hadd, no matter how
~~great he is, because there is no distinction of great or small in the
~~matter of hadd. 5. we must learn a lesson from the history of past
~~nations so that we can save ourselves from such misdeeds which caused
~~their ruin. 6. this hadith brings into prominence the distinction and
~~eminence of usamah and his position in the eyes of the prophet (pbuh).

~~commentary: "al-hadir'' means one who lives in the city, while "al-

~~deal'' here signifies that the urbanite should not go to the villager
~~and propose to him leave his goods with him for sale and he would send
~~him the sale proceeds of the goods piecemeal as they sell. in the
~~opinion of some `ulama' this is prohibited if the merchandise is
~~valuable and the villager is not aware of its real worth and the
~~urbanite wants to exploit his ignorance. but, on the contrary, if the
~~proposal is for the welfare of the villager and the urbanite merely
~~wants the owner to receive its due price then the offer is admissible.
~~the first proposition is prohibited because that will cause a loss to
~~the villager; the second is permissible as it is a well-meaning offer.
~~"a person in the city should not make a deal on behalf of a villager''
~~has been interpreted by `abdullah bin `abbas (may allah be pleased with
~~them) to mean that he should not work as a broker for a villager because
~~in that case he will be interested to sell it on a higher price in order
~~to have a better commission in the deal, which will unnecessarily raise
~~its cost. on one side, the purchase of goods coming from outside has
~~been prohibited before its arrival on the market so that nobody can
~~exploit the ignorance of the outsiders, and on the other side, villagers
~~are enjoined to sell their goods themselves so that the commission of
~~the broker does not increase the price of the goods. if an urbanite
~~sells the merchandise of any villager on a fair price without charging

~~والتصرية . متفق عليه 1778. abu hurairah (may allah be pleased with him)
~~said: the messenger of allah (pbuh) forbade that a man in the city
~~should be the commission agent of a man from the desert and prohibited
~~the practice of najsh (i.e., offering a high price for something in
~~order to allure another customer who is interested in the thing); and
~~that a man should make an offer while the offer of his brother is
~~pending; or that he should make a proposal of marriage while that of his
~~brother is pending; or that a woman should try that a sister of hers
~~might be divorced so that she might take her place. another narration
~~is: the messenger of allah (pbuh) forbade the people from meeting the
~~caravan on the way for entering into business transaction with them; and
~~the selling of the goods by a dweller of the city on behalf of a man of
~~the desert; and the seeking by a woman the divorce of her sister (from
~~her husband); and the practice of najsh and leaving the animals unmilked
~~(for sometime for the purpose of accumulation of milk to deceive the
~~buyer). [al-bukhari and muslim]. commentary: "litakfa ma fi ina'iha''
~~means that "whatever is in her vessel is overturned.'' this is a
~~figurative expression meaning "she would marry her (muslim sister's)
~~husband when he divorces her present wife.'' "leaving the animals
~~unmilked'' means that a saleable cattle is not milked for two or three
~~times to create an impression that the cattle is rich in milk, which is
~~not the true case. this is also prohibited. other points mentioned in
~~this hadith have been discussed earlier. PageV01P2326

~~وهذا لفظ مسلم 1779. ibn `umar (may allah be pleased with them) said: the
~~messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "a person should not enter into a
~~transaction when his (muslim) brother has already negotiated, nor should
~~he make a proposal of marriage when that of his brother is pending,
~~except with the permission of the latter.'' [al-bukhari and muslim]
~~commentary: we learn from this hadith that if a man knows that such and
~~such person has asked some woman for marriage and she has accepted the
~~proposal then he should not make an offer of marriage to her. but if the
~~matter has ended and the first proposal permits him to try his luck then
~~he can make a proposal to her for marriage. on the same analogy, it is
~~prohibited for a woman to send a proposal of marriage to a man with whom
~~some woman is already negotiating or has already negotiated.

~~(may allah be pleased with him) sat upon his knees and began to throw
~~pebbles upon the flatterer's face. `uthman (may allah be pleased with

~~messenger of allah (pbuh) said, `when you see those who shower undue
~~praises upon others throw dust upon their faces.''' [muslim].
~~commentary: the purpose of this hadith seems to be that one should
~~neither pay serious attention to one who praises nor reward him for it.
~~if one can throw grit in his face, that should also be done. one should
~~at least avoid such persons who are in the habit of praising people
~~unnecessarily. imam an-nawawi has stated that these ahadith are in
~~prohibition of praise while there are many in favour of it. `ulama' are
~~of the opinion that the two points of view can be reconciled. if the one
~~who is praised has perfect faith and confidence and is endowed with the
~~gift of knowledge by allah and has control over his self and thereby he
~~is not likely to go astray by praise, then praising him is neither
~~unlawful nor disgusting. but if he is vulnerable to praise then praising
~~him in his presence is abhorred. ahadith in prohibition of praise
~~support this point of view. while one of the ahadith, which are in
~~favour of praise, relates to the occasion when the prophet (may allah be
~~pleased with him) said to abu bakr as-siddiq (may allah be pleased with
~~him): "i hope that you will also be among them,'' that is "you will be
~~one of hose who will be called from every gate of jannah.'' (see, sahih

~~relates to the event when the prophet (pbuh) said to abu bakr (may allah
~~be pleased with him): "you are not one of them.'' what it signified was
~~that "you are not one of those who keep their trousers below their
~~ankles out of sheer pride.'' (see, sahih al-bukhari, manaqib abu bakr).

~~their advice and told them that an epidemic had broken out in ash-sham.
~~there was a difference of opinion whether they should proceed further or
~~retreat to their homes in such a situation. some of them said: "you have
~~set forth to fight the enemy, and therefore you should not go back;''
~~whereas some of them said: "as you have along with you many eminent
~~companions of messenger of allah (pbuh), we would not advice you to set
~~forth to the place of the plague (and thus expose them deliberately to a
~~danger).'' `umar (may allah be pleased with him) said: "you can now go
~~away.'' he said: "call to me the ansar (the helpers).'' so i called them
~~to him, and he consulted them and they differed in their opinions as
~~well. he said: "now, you may go.'' he again said: "call the old (wise
~~people) of the quraish who had emigrated before the conquest of
~~makkah.'' i called them. `umar (may allah be pleased with him) consulted
~~them in this issue and not even two persons among them differed in the
~~opinions. they said: "we think that you should go back along with the
~~people and do not take them to this scourge. `umar (may allah be pleased
~~with him) made an announcement to the people, saying: "in the morning i
~~intend to go back, and i want you to do the same.'' abu 'ubaidah bin al-
~~jarrah (may allah be pleased with him) said: "are you going to run away
~~from the divine decree?'' thereupon `umar (may allah be pleased with
~~him) said: "o abu 'ubaidah ! had it been someone else to say this.''
~~('umar (may allah be pleased with him) did not like to differ with him).
~~he said: "yes, we are running from the divine decree to the divine
~~decree. what do you think if you have camels and you happen to get down
~~a valley having two sides, one of them covered with foliage and the
~~other being barren, will you not act according to the divine decree if
~~you graze them in vegetative land? in case you graze them in the barren
~~land, even then you will be doing so according to the divine decree.
~~there happened to come `abdur-rahman bin `auf who had been absent for
~~some of his needs. he said: i have knowledge about it. i heard the
~~messenger of allah (pbuh) saying, "if you get wind of the outbreak of
~~plague in a land, you should not enter it; but if it spreads in the land
~~where you are, you should not depart from it.'' thereupon `umar bin
~~khattab (may allah be pleased with him) praised allah and went back.
~~[al-bukhari and muslim]. commentary: "ajnad'' stands for five regions of
~~syria: palestine, jordan, damascus, hims and qansarin. (an-nawawi).
~~'umar (may allah be pleased with him) praised allah for the reason that
~~his own ijtihad was in accordance with the hadith of the prophet (pbuh).
~~the opinion given by the groups of ansar and muhajirun before this
~~ijtihad was also based on some principles of shari`ah: those who had
~~advised not to return had evinced submission to the will of allah and
~~their absolute trust in him, and the other group which had preferred the
~~way of precaution had suggested to avoid any such action which could
~~prove harmful. although such precautionary measures could not save them
~~from the divine decree, they decided to take all possible precautions
~~because this is what is ordained by allah. in fact, this was the basis
~~of the ijtihad made by `umar, the veracity of which was proved by the
~~hadith of the prophet (pbuh). this hadith confirmed the point of view of
~~imam an-nawawi. thus, this hadith highlights the following four
~~important points: 1. the test of validity of any decision is its
~~correspondence with shari`ah. 2. the desirability of mutual
~~consultation. 3. the power of the imam to depart from the advice of the

~~magians when faludhaj (a sweet made of flour and honey) was brought in a
~~silver utensil, and anas did not take it. the man was told to change the
~~utensil. so he changed the utensil and when he brought it to anas, he
~~took it. [al-baihaqi]. commentary: from the above narrations, it is
~~clear that the use of utensils made of gold or silver is forbidden in
~~islam for eating, drinking and for all other purposes. however, medical
~~use of golden or silver wire is not forbidden, e.g., the use of golden
~~wire in securing teeth, or fixing a tooth partly made of gold. eating
~~and drinking in utensils of precious metals (in which platinum may also
~~be included) is forbidden as it is a show of pride and exhibition of
~~richness. all such actions are against the basic teachings of islam.
~~precious metals should not be used for decoration either. 1. however,
~~women may use precious metals as ornaments, since according to some
~~narrations there is exemption for the fair sex in this matter. still
~~some scholars maintain that the chain of such narrations is weak, so
~~they do not allow their use in the ornaments of women as well. sheikh
~~al-albani has discussed this matter in detail in adab az-zafaf and he
~~does not agree with the opinion of these other scholars. 2. silken dress
~~is also forbidden for men and, similarly all types of dresses resembling
~~silk are forbidden for them, which are a speciality of women. they are
~~forbidden as creating likeness and resemblance to women. the reason
~~behind this is that the softness and delicacy found in silk is against
~~manliness. 3. the prohibition of these things reflects the temperament
~~and disposition of islam. islam encourages simplicity and piety in
~~eating, drinking, dress and living; and forbids luxury and ease that
~~creates resemblance and likeness with the disbelievers. alas! present-
~~day muslims have adopted ease and luxury and made it the criterion of
~~nobility and are following in the footsteps of the disbelievers.
~~everyone is busy day and night to attain the western standard of living

~~حجت مصمتة فقال لها : تكلمي فإن هذا لا يحل هذا من عمل الجاهلية فتكلمت .
~~رواه البخاري 1801. qais bin abu hazim ¨(may allah be pleased with
~~him)(c) said: abu bakr (may allah be pleased with him) came upon a woman
~~named zainab from the ahmas tribe and noticed that she was observing
~~total silence. he said: "what has happened to her? why does she not
~~speak?'' people informed him that she had sworn to remain silent. he
~~then said to her: "you should speak, it is not permissible (to observe
~~silence), for it is an act of the days of ignorance (jahiliyyah).''
~~(after hearing this) she started speaking. [al-bukhari]. commentary: 1.
~~from the above narrations it becomes clear that one can not be called an
~~orphan when maturity is attained. the proof of maturity is night
~~discharge and not any particular age. the age of maturity may differ in
~~different countries according to the climate and individual body
~~development. so night discharge has been fixed as the condition and
~~criterion or sign of maturity. night discharge means ejaculation of
~~semen during sleep. 2. during the pre-islamic period, keeping quiet was
~~also considered as a sort of worship or devotion to god. islam does not
~~allow such ascetic ceremonies and extravagance. so such actions are
~~forbidden. further it has been stressed that instead of keeping quiet
~~one should engage in good actions, such as enjoining good, forbidding
~~evil, entertaining a guest, remembering allah and glorifying him.
~~however, it is better to keep quiet rather than telling lies, indulging
~~in indecent talk or backbiting. PageV01P2362

~~scroll which showed a list of what sort of camels to be given as blood-
~~money, and other legal matters relating to killing game in the sanctuary
~~of makkah and the expiation thereof. in it was also written: the
~~messenger of allah (pbuh) said: `al-madinah is a sanctuary from `air to
~~thaur (mountains). he who innovates in this territory new ideas in
~~islam, commits a sin therein, or shelters the innovators, will incur the
~~curse of allah, the angels, and all the people, and allah will accept
~~from him neither repentance nor a ransom on the day of resurrection. the
~~asylum (pledge of protection) granted by any muslim (even of the) lowest
~~status is to be honoured and respected by all other muslims, and whoever
~~betrays a muslim in this respect (by violating the pledge) will incur
~~the curse of allah, the angels, and all the people; and allah will
~~accept from him neither repentance nor a ransom on the day of
~~resurrection. whoever attributes his fatherhood to someone other than
~~his (real) father, and takes someone else as his master other than his
~~(real) master without his permission, will incur the curse of allah, the
~~angels and all the people, and allah will accept from him neither
~~repentance nor a ransom on the day of resurrection.'' [al-bukhari and
~~muslim]. commentary: air is a small mountain near al-madinah and thaur
~~is also a small mountain behind the famous mount uhud. the area between
~~these two mountains is the forbidden area. it means that like the haram
~~of makkah, no game should be killed, no trees or plants of this area
~~should be cut and no disbeliever or polytheists should enter its
~~boundary. the words "a'dl" and "sarf" translated here as 'repentance'
~~and 'ransom' respectively also mean obligatory and voluntary (nafl) acts
~~of worship. it has been established here that any act of disobedience or
~~sin committed in al-madinah becomes a greater sin than if it is
~~committed anywhere else. this hadith also establishes that the claim
~~that `ali (may allah be pleased with him) was given some specific
~~knowledge of khilafah (caliphate), which was not given to anybody else
~~is also false. the hadith also makes it clear that attributing one's
~~fatherhood to someone other than his real father is a grave sin.

~~you against him. but if he appears after i die, then everyone of you is
~~his own defender. allah is the one who remains after me to guide every
~~muslim. dajjal will be a young man with very curly hair with one eye
~~protruding (with which he cannot see). i compare (his appearance) to
~~that of al-`uzza bin qatan. he who amongst you survives to see him,
~~should recite over him the opening ayat of surat al-kahf (i.e., surat
~~18: verses 1-8). he will appear on the way between syria and iraq and
~~will spread mischief right and left. o slaves of allah! remain adhered
~~to the truth.'' we asked: "o messenger of allah! how long will he stay
~~on the earth?'' he said, "for forty days. one day will be like a year,
~~one day like a month, one day like a week and the rest of the days will
~~be like your days.'' we said: "o messenger of allah! will one day's
~~salat (prayer) suffice for the salat of that day which will be equal to
~~one year?'' thereupon he said, "no, but you must make an estimate of
~~time and then offer salat.'' we said: "o messenger of allah! how quickly
~~will he walk upon the earth?'' thereupon he said, "like cloud driven by
~~the wind (i.e., very quickly). he will come to the people and call them
~~to his obedience and they will affirm their faith in him and respond to
~~him. he will then give command to the sky and it will send its rain upon
~~the earth and he will then send his command to the earth and it will
~~grow vegetation. then in the evening their pasturing animals will come
~~to them with their humps very high and their udders full of milk and
~~their flanks stretched. he will then come to another people and invite
~~them, but they will reject him and he will leave them, in barren lands
~~and without any goods and chattels! he would then walk through the waste
~~land and say to it: `bring forth your treasures', and the treasures will
~~come out and follow him like swarms of bees. he will then call a person
~~brimming with youth and strike him with the sword and cut him into two
~~pieces and make these pieces lie at a distance, which is generally
~~between the archer and his target. he will then call that young man and
~~he will come forward, laughing, with his face gleaming out of joy; and
~~it will be at this very time that allah will send `isa (jesus), son of
~~maryam (mary) who will descend at the white minaret in the eastern side
~~of damascus, wearing two garments lightly dyed and placing his hands on
~~the wings of two angels. when he will lower his head, there would fall
~~drops of water from his head, and when he will raise it up, drops like
~~pearls would scatter from it. every disbeliever who will find his (i.e.,
~~`isa's) smell will die and his smell will reach as far as he will be
~~able to see. he will then search for dajjal until he will catch hold of
~~him at the gate of ludd (village near jerusalem), and will kill him.
~~then the people, whom allah will have protected, will come to `isa son
~~of maryam, and he will wipe their faces and will inform them of their
~~ranks in jannah, and it will be under such conditions that allah will
~~reveal to `isa these words: `i have brought forth from amongst my slaves
~~such people against whom none will be able to fight, so take these
~~people safely to the mountain.' and then allah will send ya'juj and
~~ma'juj (gog and magog people) and they will sworn down from every slope.
~~the first of them will pass the lake tabariyah (near the dead sea in
~~palestine) and drink all its water. and when the last of them will pass,
~~he will say: `there was once water there.' prophet `isa (pbuh) and his
~~companions will then be so much hard-pressed that the head of an ox will
~~be dearer to them than one hundred dinar, and `isa along with his
~~companions, will make supplication to allah, who will send insects which
~~will attack their (ya'juj and ma'juj people) neck until they all will
~~perish like a single person. prophet, `¦sa and his companions will then
~~come down and they will not find in the earth as much space as a single
~~span which would not be filled with their corpses and their stench.
~~prophet `isa and his companions will then again beseech allah, who will
~~send birds whose necks will be like those of bactrian camels, and they
~~will carry them and throw them where allah will desire. then allah will
~~send down rain which will spare no house in the city or in the
~~countryside. it would wash away the earth until it appears like a
~~mirror. then the earth will be told to bring forth its fruit and restore
~~its blessings; and as a result of this, there will grow such a big
~~pomegranate that a group of people will eat from it and seek shelter
~~under its skin. milk will be so blessed that the milk of one she-camel
~~will suffice for a large company and the cow will give so much milk,
~~that it will suffice for a whole tribe. the sheep will give so much milk
~~that the whole family will be able to drink out of that, and at that
~~time allah will send a pleasant wind which will soothe people even under
~~their armpits, and will take the life of every muslim and true believer,
~~and only the wicked will survive. they will commit adultery in public
~~like asses and the resurrection day will be held.'' [muslim].

~~the day of resurrection, the appearance of dajjal (antichrist), the
~~coming of prophet `isa - son of maryam, and the appearance of gog and
~~magog people. we also find all the important events which will happen
~~during these times. here, we also note the havoc of dajjal and the

~~`abdullah bin `amr bin al-`as (may allah be pleased with them) said: the
~~messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "dajjal (the antichrist) will appear in
~~my ummah and he will stay in the world for forty. i do not know whether
~~this will be forty days or forty months or forty years. allah will then
~~send (prophet) `isa (jesus), son of maryam (mary). `isa will pursue him
~~and slaughter him. then people will survive for seven years (i.e., after
~~the demise of `isa) in the state that there will be no rancour between
~~two persons. then allah will send a cool breeze from the side of ash-
~~sham. none will remain upon the face of the earth having the smallest
~~particle of good or faith in him but he will die, so much so that even
~~if someone amongst you will enter the innermost part of a mountain, this
~~breeze will reach that place also and will cause him to die. only the
~~wicked people will survive and they will be as fast as birds (i.e., to
~~commit evil) and as ferocious towards one another as wild beasts. they
~~will never appreciate the good, nor condemn evil. then shaitan (satan)
~~will come to them in the garb of a man and will say: `will you not obey
~~me?' they will say: `what do you order us to do?' he will command them
~~to worship idols. they will have abundance of sustenance and will lead
~~comfortable lives. then the trumpet will be blown. every one hearing it,
~~will turn his neck towards it and will raise it. the first one to hear
~~that trumpet will be a man who will be busy repairing the basin for his
~~camels. he will become unconscious. allah will send, or will cause to
~~send, rain which will be like dew and there will grow out of it (like
~~wild growth) the bodies of the people. then the second trumpet will be
~~blown and they will stand up and begin to look around. then it will be
~~said: `o people! go to your rubb.' then there will be a command: `make
~~them stand there.' after it they will be called to account. then it will
~~be said: `separate from them the share of the fire.' it will be asked:

~~thousand.' that will be the day which will make children hoary-headed
~~men because of its terror and that will be the day when the shin will be
~~uncovered.'' [muslim]. commentary: the question arises as to what is the
~~meaning of the phrase - the shin will be uncovered - at this place? some
~~people say that it refers to the calamities and troubles of the day of
~~judgement. but according to a reliable narration, it refers to an act of
~~allah of uncovering his shin in a way which befits his majesty. as
~~believers, we must confirm allah's all qualities which he has stated in
~~the qur'an or mentioned through his messenger (pbuh) without changing
~~them or ignoring them completely or twisting their meanings or giving
~~resemblance to any of the created things. what is meant by the
~~uncovering of the shin of allah is something we can neither understand
~~nor describe. we can only believe in it without understanding the real
~~explanation of it, in the same way we believe in the eye or ear of
~~allah. we should believe in all these things as mentioned in the qur'an
~~and hadith without trying to go into the explanation. this is the view
~~of ahlus-sunnah wal-jama`ah to which we should stick. (see tafsir ahsan-
~~ul-bayan) then all the muslims will prostrate before him. however, those
~~people who used to pray and prostrate before him in their worldly lives
~~only for showing off or for gaining good reputation, will not be able to
~~prostrate before him on this occasion. their spines will become stiff
~~like a wooden board and it would become impossible for them to bend.

~~will go towards him and the armed watchmen of dajjal will meet him and
~~they will say to him: `where do you intend to go?' he will say: `i

~~laid on his stomach and have his head. he will be struck on his back and
~~on his stomach. dajjal will ask him: `don't you believe in me?' he will
~~say: `you are the false messiah.' he will then give his order to have
~~him sawn with a saw into two from the parting of his hair up to his
~~legs. after that dajjal will walk between the two halves and will say to
~~him: `stand up', and he will stand on his feet. he will then say to him:
~~`don't you believe in me?' the person will say: `it has added to my
~~insight that you are dajjal'. he will add: `o people! he will not be
~~able to behave with anyone amongst people in such a manner after me.'
~~dajjal will try to kill him. the space between his neck and collarbone
~~will turn into copper and he will find no way to kill him. so he will
~~catch hold of him by his hand and feet and throw him into (what appears

~~because of his mischief. the meaning of dajjal is `one who greatly
~~resorts to fraud and deception'. allah will also give him some
~~extraordinary powers to test the belief of the muslims. dajjal will
~~claim to be the lord of the world. a large portion of the jews will be

~~account of the scarcity of men and excess of women.'' [muslim].
~~commentary: this hadith also reveals one of the prophecies of the
~~prophet (pbuh) which have not been fulfilled yet. one of them is that
~~wealth will be abundant and females will greatly exceed the males in

~~hurairah (may allah be pleased with him) reported: the prophet (pbuh)
~~said, "a man bought a piece of land from another man, and the buyer
~~found a jar filled with gold in the land. the buyer said to the seller:
~~`take your gold, as i bought only the land from you and not the gold.'
~~the owner of the land said: `i sold you the land with everything in it.'
~~so both of them took their case before a third man who asked: `have you
~~any children?' one of them said: `i have a boy.' the other said, `i have
~~a girl.' the man said: `marry the girl to the boy and spend the money on
~~them; and whatever remains give it in charity.''' [al-bukhari and
~~muslim]. commentary: this is the story of some people from the past, in
~~which exemplary honesty, piety and the will to abstain from the doubtful
~~property has been described. but as far as the law of shari`ah is
~~concerned, it appears that in the transaction of land, any buried
~~treasure will not be included in the sale. it will be considered quite
~~separately and apart from the sale of the land. if the previous owner
~~says that the treasure belongs to him and he forgot to take it out, then
~~it will be considered as his property and not the property of the buyer
~~of the land. but if he shows ignorance about it, then it will be
~~considered under the title of "rikaz". in such a case, one-fifth of it
~~goes to the public treasury and the rest to the owner of the land. rikaz
~~refers to any buried treasure which is discovered in any land.

~~shame, then he does not mind doing anything. for this reasons the
~~western nations intend to finish the feeling of shame and remorse among

~~of allah. they have also been bestowed with such powers as are not
~~possessed by humans. satan also belongs to the jinn. man has been

# وعنها رضي الله عنها قالت قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم : [ من أحب
~~لقاء الله أحب الله لقاءه ومن كره لقاء الله كره الله لقاءه ] فقلت : يا
~~رسول الله أكراهية الموت فكلنا يكره الموت ؟ قال : [ ليس كذلك ولكن المؤمن
~~إذا بشر برحمة الله ورضوانه وجنته أحب لقاء الله فأحب الله لقاءه وإن
~~الكافر إذا بشر بعذاب الله وسخطه كره لقاء الله وكره الله لقاءه ] رواه
~~مسلم 1848. `aishah (may allah be pleased with her) reported: the
~~messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "he who loves to meet allah, allah loves
~~to meet him; and he who dislikes to meet allah, allah abhors to meet
~~him.'' i (`aishah) said: "o messenger of allah! so far as the feelings
~~of aversion against death is concerned, we all have this feeling.''
~~thereupon he said, "i do not mean that. what i meant is that when a
~~(true) believer is given the glad tidings of the mercy of allah, his
~~pleasures and his jannah (at the time of death), he loves to meet allah,
~~and allah also loves to meet him. when a disbeliever is given the news
~~of the torment of allah and his wrath (at the time of death), he
~~dislikes to meet allah and allah also abhors to meet him.'' [muslim].
~~commentary: the glad tidings of jannah are given to the believers and
~~the bad news of punishment are given to the disbelievers at the time of
~~death. so a believer starts longing to meet allah as a result of the
~~good news he receives at that time, and the disbeliever begins to wish
~~that he may not die and, therefore, avoid allah's punishment as a result
~~of the bad news he receives at that time. PageV01P2416

# وعن أم المؤمنين صفية بنت حيي رضي الله عنها قالت : كان النبي صلى الله
~~عليه وسلم معتكفا فأتيته أزوره ليلا فحدثته ثم قمت لأنقلب فقام معي ليقلبني
~~فمر رجلان من الأنصار رضي الله عنهم فلما رأيا النبي صلى الله عليه و سلم
~~أسرعا فقال النبي صلى الله عليه و سلم : [ على رسلكما إنها صفية بنت حيي ]
~~فقالا : سبحان الله يا رسول الله . فقال : [ إن الشيطان يجري من ابن آدم
~~مجري الدم وإني خشيت أن يقذف في قلوبكما شرا أو قال شيئا ] متفق عليه 1849.
~~safiyyah bint huyai (may allah be pleased with him), the mother of the
~~believers, said: i came to visit the prophet (pbuh) while he was in the
~~state of i`tikaf [(seclusion) in the mosque during the last ten days of
~~ramadan]. after having talked to him, i got up to return. the prophet
~~(pbuh) also got up with me and accompanied me a part of the way. at that
~~moment two ansari man passed by. when they saw him they quickened their
~~pace. the prophet (pbuh) said to them, "do not hurry. she is safiyyah,
~~daughter of huyai, my wife.'' they said: "subhan allah (allah is free
~~from imperfection)! o messenger of allah! (you are far away from any
~~suspicion).'' the messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "satan circulates in a
~~person like blood (in the blood streams). i apprehended lest satan
~~should drop some evil thoughts in your minds.'' [al-bukhari and muslim].
~~commentary: even just a passing thought of some thing undesirable about
~~the prophet (pbuh) is dangerous for belief. in order to put an end to
~~this evil suspicion, he stopped the two companions and explained to them
~~the situation. this was done lest the devil may create some doubt in the
~~mind of the two companions. the conclusion is that, if at any place
~~there is some far fetched chance of creation of bad opinion about
~~somebody, then it is necessary to give an explanation lest some doubt
~~may arise in some body's mind. this is particularly essential for
~~`ulama', who should remain aloof from such occasions and places, lest
~~the people may start doubting their integrity and piety. PageV01P2417

~~him) said: i was in the company of the messenger of allah (pbuh) on the
~~day of (the battle of) hunain. abu sufyan bin al-harith and i did not
~~leave the messenger of allah (pbuh) throughout the battle. the messenger
~~of allah (pbuh) was riding on his white mule. when the muslims had an
~~encounter with the pagans, muslims took to their heels. the messenger of
~~allah (pbuh) began to urge his mule towards the disbelievers, holding
~~the bridle of his mule. i was trying to restrain it from going very
~~fast, and abu sufyan was holding the stirrup of the mule of the
~~messenger of allah (pbuh). the messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "o abbas!
~~call out the people of as-samurah [i.e., those people who had made the
~~covenant under the tree (i.e., bai`ah ridwan)].'' `abbas called out at
~~the top of his voice: "where are the people of as-samurah.'' `abbas
~~said: as soon as they heard my voice, they rushed towards the prophet
~~(pbuh) like a cow turning towards her calf. they were shouting: "here we
~~are.'' soon they began to fight the infidels. then there was a call for
~~ansar. those who called out to them shouted: "o you the people of ansar!
~~o you the people of ansar!'' they ended their call at banu al-harith bin
~~al-khazraj. the messenger of allah (pbuh) who was riding on his mule
~~looked at their fight with his neck stretched forward and he said, "this
~~is the time when the fight is raging hot.'' then the messenger of allah
~~(pbuh) took pebbles and threw them in the face of the disbelievers. he
~~said, "by the rubb of muhammad, the disbelievers will be defeated.'' i
~~continued to watch until i found that their force was subdued and they
~~began to retreat. [muslim]. commentary: 1. here is the factual proof of
~~the bravery and greatness of the prophet (pbuh). we see that initially
~~when the companions were perturbed and they scattered here and there, he
~~alone continued his march towards the enemy. he did not feel even the
~~slightest fear or worry. in the end his steadfastness compelled others
~~to return and fight the enemy. 2. in fact, they had not receded far.
~~they had got confused for a while. the reason for this confusion was the
~~continuous and sudden volley of arrows which was quite unexpected for
~~them. however, at the call of al-`abbas (may allah be pleased with him)
~~they at once turned back to fight. had they gone far off, their sudden
~~re-organisation and collecting again would not have been possible. 3.
~~here is the proof of a miracle of the prophet (pbuh) as well; the
~~throwing of few pebbles from his side caused the defeat of the enemy. 4.
~~here, the muslims were taught a lesson that the real power in the
~~battlefield is the strength of belief and the help of allah. the
~~position of the armaments and other things is secondary. so, one should
~~not depend on these means and resources alone. otherwise, one will
~~certainly face defeat in spite of large number of soldiers and better
~~means, as happened initially in the battle of hunain. the trust should
~~be on allah and his special help. his will alone is the deciding factor
~~in every matter. PageV01P2418

~~therefore, accepts only that which is pure. allah has commanded the
~~believers as he has commanded his messengers by saying: `o messengers!
~~eat of the good things, and do good deeds.' (23:51) and he said: `o you
~~who believe (in the oneness of allah - islamic monotheism)! eat of the
~~lawful things that we have provided you...''' (2:172). then he (pbuh)
~~made a mention of the person who travels for a long period of time, his

~~the sky and thus makes the supplication: `my rubb! my rubb!' but his
~~food is unlawful, his drink is unlawful, his clothes are unlawful and
~~his nourishment is unlawful, how can, then his supplication be
~~accepted?'' [muslim]. commentary: for the grant of prayer, honest
~~earning is essential. allah accepts charity only if it has been earned
~~in an honest way. moreover, before any pious action, honest earning for
~~living is essential; otherwise good actions will also go waste.

~~"day'' mean, and how long can it be? its reality only allah knows. we
~~observe a day of 24 hours. however, the days of the formation of the

~~commentary: in such matters about which there is no clear command or
~~instruction in the qur'an and sunnah, the problem is decided keeping in
~~view similar and resembling cases. this mode of deciding about its being
~~permitted or prohibited is called ijtihad. evidently, this process can
~~be employed by only such a person who has full command about the various
~~branches of knowledge pertaining to qur'an and sunnah. not every person
~~can do it nor is supposed to do it. there is also a famous proverb that
~~says: `little knowledge is a dangerous thing.' from here we conclude
~~that the ruler, judge or a bureaucrat in a muslim country should be a
~~learned scholar, i.e., an `alim well versed in qur'an and sunnah; so
~~that he can interpret the laws of islam with utmost care and in a
~~befitting and sincere manner. he should do the job sincerely and with a
~~pious intention. with such mode of work, he will be bestowed with reward

~~dies without observing saum (fasts), his wali should make it up on his
~~behalf.'' [al-bukhari and muslim]. commentary: sheikh al-albani says
~~that this fasting refers to fasting of vow and not the fasting of
~~ramadan. sheikh al-albani has particularized the narration by `aishah
~~(may allah be pleased with her) with the help of the narration of ibn
~~`abbas (may allah be pleased with them), in which the fasting of vow is
~~specifically mentioned. the reason is that in the bodily worship, acting
~~on the behalf of others is not permitted. as one cannot act or perform
~~any bodily worship on behalf of others, similarly it is not allowed to
~~do so after somebody's death. however, if in any particular case, there
~~is a ruling in the qur'an or sunnah then in that particular matter
~~deputizing would be allowed. in such case the permission should be
~~limited to that particular matter only. for example it is specifically
~~mentioned in the hadith that the wali, i.e., the guardian or inheritor
~~of the dead person can observe the fasting of vow taken by the deceased
~~person to allah. however, no offering of other bodily worship, such as

~~had said in respect of selling of a gift which was presented to her: "by
~~allah! if `aishah does not stop this kind of thing, i will declare her
~~incompetent to administer her property.'' `aishah (may allah be pleased

~~said: "yes.'' `aishah (may allah be pleased with her) said: "i vow it

~~desertion lasted long, `abdullah bin az-zubair sought intercession with
~~her, but she said: "by allah i will not accept the intercession of
~~anyone for him, and i will not commit a sin of breaking my vow.'' when
~~this state of affairs was prolonged, ibn az-zubair felt it hard on him.
~~he said to al-miswar bin makhramah and `abdur-rahman bin al-aswad bin
~~yaghut: "i beseech you in the name of allah that you should take me to
~~`aishah because it is unlawful for her to vow to sever relations with

~~permission, saying: "as-salamu `alaika wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuhu!
~~shall we come in?'' `aishah (may allah be pleased with her) said: "come
~~in,'' they asked: "all of us?'' she said: "all of you,'' not knowing
~~that ibn az-zubair was also with them. so, when they entered, ibn az-
~~zubair entered the screened place and got hold of `aishah (may allah be
~~pleased with her), his aunt. he was requesting her to forgive him and
~~wept. al-miswar and `abdur-rahman also pleaded on his behalf and
~~requested her to speak to him and to accept his repentance. they said to
~~her: "the prophet (pbuh) forbade to cut off relationship because it is
~~unlawful for any muslim not to talk to his (muslim) brother (or sister,
~~for that matter) for more than three (days).'' so when they persisted in
~~urging and reminding her of the superiority of having good relation with
~~kith and kin, she began to weep, saying: "i have made a vow which is a
~~matter of very serious nature.'' they persisted in their appeal till she
~~spoke with `abdullah bin az-zubair, and she freed forty slaves as an
~~expiation for breaking her vow. later on, whenever she remembered her
~~vow, she would weep so much that her veil would become wet with tears.
~~[al-bukhari]. commentary: `abdullah bin az-zubair (may allah be pleased
~~with him) was the real nephew of `aishah (may allah be pleased with
~~her). she had made a vow that she would not talk to her nephew. she
~~thought that such an oath was permissible as her nephew (the then
~~governor of makkah) had shown his intention to put a ban on the spending
~~of `aishah (may allah be pleased with her). in his opinion, she was
~~spending very lavishly in charity. later `abdullah bin az-zubair (may
~~allah be pleased with him) realized his mistake and went to his aunt to
~~seek forgiveness along with two persons as recommenders. after this, it
~~was proper for her to break her oath and resume her relations with him.
~~the expiation for breaking a vow is the same as that of breaking an
~~oath, i.e., to feed ten indigent people on a scale of the average for
~~the food of one's family, or cloth them, or give a slave his freedom. if
~~one cannot afford any of these things, then he should fast for three
~~days. (see qur'an, 5:89) but `aishah (may allah be pleased with her), in

# وعن أبي هريرة رضي الله عنه قال قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم : [
~~من قتل وزغة في أول ضربة فله كذا وكذا حسنة ومن قتلها في الضربة الثانية
~~فله كذا وكذا حسنة دون الأولي وإن قتلها في الضربة الثالثة فله كذا وكذا
~~حسنة ] وفي رواية : [ من قتل وزغا في أول ضربة كتب له مائة حسنة وفي
~~الثانية دون ذلك وفي الثالثة دون ذلك ] رواه مسلم قال أهل اللغة : الوزغ :
~~العظام من سام أبرص 1864. abu hurairah (may allah be pleased with him)
~~said: the messenger of allah (pbuh) said, "he who kills a chameleon at
~~the first blow, such and such number of good deeds will be awarded to
~~him; whoever kills it at the second blow, such and such number of merits
~~will be recorded for him. and if he kills it at the third blow, he will
~~get such and such merits.'' another narration is: the messenger of allah
~~(pbuh) said, "if anyone kills a chameleon with the first blow, a hundred
~~good deeds will be recorded for him; less than that will be recorded for
~~him if he kills it at the second blow, and still less rewards will be
~~recorded for him if he kills it at the third blow.'' [muslim].
~~commentary: here, it is mentioned that the killing of a chameleon in one
~~stroke is very commendable. similar is the case of killing of other
~~harmful insects and reptiles such as scorpions, and snakes. this shows
~~that even a slight help in good or bad actions will be counted and
~~rewarded or punished as the case may be. the matter of quantity is not
~~so important, but the real thing is the intention and real motive. it
~~could be that the chameleon did, in fact, blew fire on ibrahim; or it
~~could be that it simply refers to the chameleon's harmful nature to
~~human beings. allah knows better. PageV01P2432

# 1866. abu hurairah (may allah be pleased with him) reported: we
~~accompanied the messenger of allah (pbuh) to a banquet. the meat of the
~~forearm was presented to him as he was very fond of it. the messenger of
~~allah (pbuh) ate a morsel of it and said, "i will be the master of all
~~the people on the day of resurrection. do you know why? allah will
~~gather all human beings, past and present generations on the same ground
~~so that the announcer may be able to make them all hear his voice and
~~the onlookers may be able to see all of them. the sun will come very
~~close to the people, they will suffer such distress and trouble as they
~~will not be able to bear. then the people will say: `do you see our
~~(miserable) condition? you should look for someone who can intercede for
~~you with your rubb.' some people will say to the others: `go to your
~~father, adam.' so they will go to adam and say to him: `you are the
~~father of mankind; allah created you with his own hand, and breathed
~~into you of his spirit, ordered the angels to prostrate before you and
~~he made you dwell in jannah. so (please) intercede for us with your
~~rubb. do you not see our (miserable) condition?' adam will say: `today
~~my rubb has become so angry as he has never been before, nor will he
~~ever become angry after this. he forbade me to approach the tree, but i
~~disobeyed him. i am worried about myself. go to someone else. go to
~~(prophet) nuh (noah).' they will come to nuh and will say to him: `o
~~nuh! you are the first of messenger of allah to the people on the earth,
~~and allah has named you a grateful slave. please intercede for us with
~~your rubb. do you not see our (miserable) condition?' he will say:
~~`today my rubb his become so angry as he has never been before, nor will
~~he become angry hereafter. i was granted the right to make one
~~definitely accepted invocation. i availed of this opportunity and made
~~it against my nation. i am worried about myself. go to someone else. go
~~to (prophet) ibrahim (abraham).' they will go to ibrahim and say to him:
~~`o ibrahim, you are messenger of allah and his khalil (the intimate
~~friend of allah) from among the people of the earth; so please intercede
~~for us with your rubb. don't you see our (miserable) condition?' he will
~~say to them: `today my rubb has become so angry as he has never been
~~before; nor will he ever be so hereafter. i had told three lies. i am
~~worried about myself. go to someone else. go to (prophet) musa (moses).'
~~the people will then go to musa and say to him: `o musa! you are
~~messenger of allah and allah gave you superiority above the others with
~~his message and with his direct talk to you, so intercede for us with
~~your rubb. do you not see our (miserable) condition?' musa will say:
~~`today my rubb has become so angry as he has never been before, nor will
~~he ever be hereafter. i killed a man whom i had not been ordered to
~~kill. i am worried about myself. go to someone else. go to (prophet)
~~`isa (jesus).' so they will go to `¦sa and say to him: `o `isa! you are
~~messenger of allah and his word (i.e., "be''-and he was) which he
~~bestowed on maryam (mary) and a spirit created by him; and you talked to
~~the people while you were in the cradle. please intercede for us with
~~your rubb. do you not see our (miserable) condition?' `¦sa will say:
~~`today my rubb has become so angry as he has never been before, nor will
~~he ever be like this hereafter.' `isa will not mention any sin, but will
~~say: `i am worried about myself. go to someone else. go to muhammad
~~(pbuh).''' another narration is: the messenger of allah said, "they will
~~come to me and say: `o muhammad! you are the messenger of allah and the
~~last of prophets, and allah has forgiven your past and future sins.
~~please intercede for us with your rubb. do you not see our (miserable)
~~condition?''' the messenger of allah (pbuh) added, "then i will proceed
~~under allah's throne and fall down in prostration before my rubb. then,
~~he will bestow upon me knowledge of such praises and glorification to
~~him as he has never bestowed upon anybody else before me. then i will be
~~addressed: `o muhammad! raise your head. ask, and your request will be
~~granted. intercede, and your intercession will be accepted.' so i will
~~raise my head and say: `my followers, o my rubb! my followers, o my
~~rubb! my followers, o my rubb!' it will be said: `o muhammad! admit into
~~jannah such people as are not subjected to reckoning through the right
~~gate of jannah.' the rest of them will be admitted along with the rest
~~of mankind through the various gates of jannah.'' the messenger of allah
~~(pbuh) further said, "by him in whose hand my soul is! the distance
~~between every two sides of the gates of jannah is like the distance
~~between makkah and hajar, or that between makkah and busra (syria).''
~~[al-bukhari and muslim] commentary: 1. hajar is a town in bahrain and
~~busra is a city in harran which is situated in the south of damascus.
~~this means that each of the gates of the jannah will be so broad that
~~the distance between its two sides would be thousands of miles. 2. in
~~this narration, the greatness and superiority of the prophet (pbuh) has
~~been described. on the day of resurrection when the great prophets would
~~not dare to speak or request leniency for mankind, only muhammad (pbuh)
~~would intercede for the people and request for mercy by the permission
~~of allah. the first request which he will make would be that
~~accountability may be started, so that the people may be freed as soon
~~as possible from the hardships and troubles of the day of resurrection.
~~this part of the hadith has not been mentioned in this narration; but it
~~has been described in other narrations. this would be a general request.
~~the second intercession will be for his own ummah. this will take place
~~in several stages. here, the first stage has been mentioned. in this
~~stage allah will send those people to jannah whose accountability would
~~not be necessary. next stage would be when the sinners among the
~~believers would have completed their period of punishment in hell and
~~then allah will send them to jannah upon the intercession of the prophet
~~(pbuh). other prophets will seek to be excused from recommending or
~~advocating because of some of their slips. the real reason for this
~~attitude of theirs is that they are on such high pedestal of greatness
~~and piety that even a slight slip of theirs which does come under the
~~boundary of unworthiness would be felt by them to be very significant.
~~this is just like the proverb which says that even the nice action of
~~the pious ones are considered to be the blemishes and defects for the
~~friends of allah. similar is the case with the prophets, they excused
~~themselves from advocating their case before allah because of their
~~insignificant slips. 3. special reference may be made of the three
~~statements of prophet ibrahim which were apparently not according to the
~~outward facts, so they have been described as `not factual'. in reality
~~they were not mis-statements, but only a way of convincing the people
~~about the basic universal truth, and making them realize their
~~misunderstanding. these three are mentioned in a long hadith narrated on
~~the authority of abu hurairah (may allah be pleased with him): ibrahim
~~(pbuh) did not tell a lie except on three occasions. twice for the sake
~~of allah when he said, "i am sick'' (37:89) and he said, "(i have not
~~done this) but the big idol had done it.'' (21:63) (the third was) that
~~while ibrahim and sarah (his wife) were going (on a journey) they passed
~~by (the territory of) a tyrant from among the tyrants. someone said to
~~the tyrant, "this man (i.e., ibrahim) is accompanied by a very charming
~~lady.'' so, he sent for ibrahim and asked him about sarah, saying, "who
~~is this lady?'' ibrahim said, "she is my sister.'' ibrahim went to sarah
~~and said, "o sarah! there are no believers on the surface of the earth
~~except you and i. this man asked me about you and i told him that you
~~are my sister. so do not contradict my statement...'' (al-bukhari, vol.
~~4, hadith no. 578) the idolaters invited ibrahim to join them in their
~~celebrations outside the city, but he refused, claiming that he was
~~sick. when he was left alone, he came to their idols and broke them.
~~when the idolaters questioned him, he claimed that he had not destroyed
~~their idols but the chief idol had, which ibrahim left undisturbed and
~~on whose shoulder he had put an axe to lay the accusation on it. to
~~conclude, ibrahim, like all other prophets is free from sins, but the
~~three acts which he made in good faith were to guide his people to the
~~truth and to save his wife from the evil of the then tyrant.

# وعن ابن عباس رضي الله عنهما قال : جاء إبراهيم صلى الله عليه و سلم بأم
~~إسماعيل وبابنها إسماعيل وهي ترضعه حتى وضعها عند البيت عند دوحة فوق زمزم
~~في أعلى المسجد وليس بمكة يومئذ أحد وليس بها ماء فوضعهما هناك ووضع عندهما
~~جرابا فيه تمر وسقاء فيه ماء ثم قفى إبراهيم منطلقا فتبعته أم إسماعيل
~~فقالت : يا إبراهيم أين تذهب وتتركنا بهذا الوادي الذي ليس فيه أنيس ولا
~~شيء ؟ فقالت له ذلك مرارا وجعل لا يلتفت إليها فقالت له : آلله أمرك بهذا ؟
~~قال : نعم قالت : إذا لا يضيعنا ثم رجعت فانطلق إبراهيم صلى الله عليه و

# 1867. ibn `abbas (may allah be pleased with them) reported: ibrahim
~~(pbuh) brought his wife and her son isma`il (pbuh), while she was
~~suckling him, to a place near the ka`bah under a tree on the spot of
~~zamzam, at the highest place in the mosque. in those days, there was no
~~human being in makkah, nor was there any water. so he made them sit over
~~there and placed near them a leather bag containing some dates, and a
~~small water-skin containing some water, and set out homeward. isma`il's
~~mother followed him saying: "o ibrahim! where are you going, leaving us
~~in this valley where there is no person whose company we may enjoy, nor
~~is there anything (to enjoy)?'' she repeated that to him many times, but
~~he did not look back at her. then she asked him: "has allah commanded
~~you to do so?'' he said: "yes.'' she said: "then he will not neglect
~~us.'' she returned while ibrahim proceeded onwards. having reached the
~~thaniya, where they could not see him, he faced ka`bah, raised his both
~~hands and supplicated: "o our rubb! i have made some of my offspring to
~~dwell in an uncultivable valley by your sacred house (the ka`bah at
~~makkah) in order, o our rubb, that they may perform as-salat (iqamat-as-
~~salat). so fill some hearts among men with love towards them, and (o
~~allah) provide them with fruits so that they may give thanks.'' (14:37).
~~isma`il's mother went on suckling isma`il and drinking from the water
~~which she had. when the water in the water-skin had all been used up,
~~she became thirsty and her child also became thirsty. she started
~~looking at isma`il, tossing in agony. she left him, for she could not
~~endure looking at him, and found that the mountain of as-safa was the
~~nearest mountain to her on that land. she stood on it and started
~~looking at the valley keenly so that she might see somebody, but she
~~could not see anybody. then she descended from as-safa, and when she
~~reached the valley, she tucked up her robe and ran in the valley like a
~~person in distress and trouble till she crossed the valley and reached
~~al-marwah mountain where she stood and started looking, expecting to see
~~somebody, but she could not see anybody. she repeated that (running
~~between as-safa and al-marwah) seven times.'' ibn `abbas further
~~related: the prophet (pbuh) said, "this is the source of the tradition
~~of the sa`y - i.e., the going of people between the two mountains. when
~~she reached al-marwah (for the last time), she heard a voice and she
~~exclaimed: `shshs!' (silencing herself) and listened attentively. she
~~heard the voice again and said: `o (whoever you may be) you have made me
~~hear your voice; have you any succour for me?' and behold! she saw an
~~angel at the place of zamzam, digging the earth with his heel (or with
~~his wing), till water flowed out from that place. she started to make
~~something like of a basin around it, using her hands in this way and
~~began to fill her water-skin with water with her hands, and the water
~~was flowing out until she had scooped some of it.'' the prophet (pbuh)
~~further said, "may allah bestow mercy on isma'il's mother! had she let
~~the zamzam flow without trying to control it (or had she not scooped in
~~that water) while filling her water-skin, zamzam would have been a
~~stream flowing on the surface of the earth.'' the prophet (pbuh) further
~~added, "then she drank (water) and suckled her child. the angel said to
~~her: `do not be afraid of being neglected, for this is the site on which
~~the house of allah will be built by this boy and his father, and allah
~~will never let neglected his people.' the house of allah (the ka`bah) at
~~that time was on a high place resembling a hillock, and when torrents
~~came, they flowed to its right and left. she continued living in that
~~way till some people from the tribe of jurhum passed by her and her
~~child. as they were coming from through the way of kada`, in the lower
~~part of makkah where they saw a bird that had a habit of flying around
~~water and not leaving it. they said: `this bird must be flying over
~~water, though we know that there is no water in this valley.' they sent
~~one or two messengers who discovered the source of water, and returned
~~to inform them of the water. so, they all came towards the water.'' the
~~prophet (pbuh) added, "isma`il's mother was sitting near the water. they
~~asked her: `do you allow us to stay with you?' she replied: `yes, but
~~you will have no right to possess the water.' they agreed to that.'' the
~~prophet (pbuh) further said, "isma`il's mother was pleased with the
~~whole situation as she used to love the company of the people. so, they
~~settled there, and later on they sent for their families who came and
~~settled with them. the child (i.e., isma`il) grew up and learnt arabic
~~from them (his virtues) caused them to love and admire him as he grew
~~up, and when he reached the age of puberty, they gave him one of their
~~daughters in marriage. after isma`il's mother had died, ibrahim came
~~after isma`il's marriage in order to see his family that he had left
~~before, but he did not find isma`il there. when he asked isma`il's wife
~~about him, she replied: `he has gone in search of our livelihood.' then
~~he asked her about their way of living and their condition, and she
~~replied complaining to him: `we are living in hardship, misery and
~~destitution.' he said: `when your husband returns, convey my salutations
~~to him and tell him to change the threshold of the door of his house.'
~~when isma`il came, he seemed to have perceived something unusual. he
~~asked his wife: `did anyone visit you?' she replied: `yes, an old man of
~~such and such description came and asked me about you and i informed
~~him, and he asked about our state of living, and, i told him that we
~~were living in hardship and poverty.' thereupon isma`il said: `did he
~~advise you anything?' she replied: `yes, he told me to convey his
~~salutations to you and to change the threshold of your door.' isma`il
~~said: `that was my father, and he has ordered me to divorce you. go back
~~to your family.' so isma`il divorced her and married another woman from
~~amongst them (jurhum). then ibrahim stayed away from them for a period
~~as long as allah wished, and called on them again but did not find
~~isma`il. so he came to isma`il's wife and asked her about him. she said:
~~`he has gone in search of our livelihood.' ibrahim asked her about their
~~sustenance and living: `how are you getting on?' she replied: `we are
~~prosperous and well off.' then she praised allah, the exalted. ibrahim
~~asked: `what kind of food do you eat?' she said: `meat.' he said: `what
~~do you drink?' she said: `water.' he said, `o allah! bless their meat
~~and water!''' the prophet (pbuh) added, "at that time they did not have
~~grain, and if they had grain, he would have also invoked allah to bless
~~it.'' the prophet (pbuh) further said, "if somebody has only these two
~~things as his sustenance, his health and disposition will be badly
~~affected because these things do not suit him unless he lives in
~~makkah.'' the prophet (pbuh) added, "then ibrahim said to isma`il's
~~wife, `when your husband comes, give my regards to him and tell him that
~~he should keep firm the threshold of his door.' when isma`il came back,
~~he asked his wife: `did anyone call on you?' she replied: `yes, a good
~~looking old man came to me.' she praised him and added: `he asked about
~~you, and i informed him, and he asked about our livelihood and i told
~~him that we were in good condition.' isma`il asked her: `did he give you
~~a piece of advice?' she said: `yes, he told me to convey his regards to
~~you and ordered that you should keep firm the threshold of your door.'
~~on that isma`il said: `he was my father and you are the threshold of the
~~door. he has ordered me to keep you with me.' then ibrahim stayed away
~~from them for a period as long as allah wished and called on them
~~afterwards. he saw isma`il under a tree near zamzam, sharpening his
~~arrows. when he saw ibrahim, he rose up to welcome him, and they greeted
~~each other as a father does with his son or a son does with his father.
~~ibrahim said: `o isma`il! allah has given me an order.' isma`il said:
~~`do what your rubb has commanded you to do.' ibrahim asked: `will you
~~help me?' isma`il said: `i will help you.' ibrahim said: `allah has
~~ordered me to build a house here, pointing to a hillock higher than the
~~land surrounding it.''' the messenger of allah (pbuh) added, "then they
~~raised the foundations of the house (i.e., ka`bah). isma`il brought the
~~stones and ibrahim was building (the house). when the walls became high,
~~isma`il brought stone and placed it for ibrahim who stood over it and
~~carried on building the house, while isma`il was handing over the stones
~~to him, both of them prayed: `o our rubb! accept this service from us!
~~verily, you are the all-hearer and the all-knower.''' [al-bukhari].
~~there are some more narrations about this incident, some adding details
~~and some with minor variations in the wordings. commentary: 1. in this
~~narration, there is the historical background of walking briskly between
~~the hills of as-safa and al-marwah. this ritual of hajj and `umrah has
~~been fixed as a remembrance of the incident about what hajirah (may
~~allah be pleased with her) had to face and what she did in the difficult
~~circumstances. in fact, she was so pious and obedient that she agreed to
~~live in such wilderness where there was no sign of any human being far
~~and wide. secondly, there was no water to drink or food for subsistence.
~~for this act of piety, she was rewarded with two things; firstly, she
~~was bestowed with an eternally flowing spring which proved for her at
~~that moment a source of life, and people still benefit from it today.
~~secondly, her brisk movement and running between the two hills was made
~~an important and compulsory ritual to be performed during hajj and
~~`umrah. this ritual is to continue for all times till the day of
~~resurrection. 2. ka`bah was built by prophet ibrahim and prophet
~~isma`il. 3. thanking allah under all circumstances is an act of praise
~~and piety while the reverse of this attitude is disliked and considered
~~reprehensible. 4. if a father asks his son to do something, then the
~~child should respond to the father's request as long as he does not
~~order him to disobey allah. PageV01P2435

~~allah (pbuh) saying, "truffle (edible fungus) is a species of al-manna

~~commentary: al-manna is the famous kind of food which allah bestowed
~~upon banu israel. as-salwa was a kind of bird resembling the quail. it
~~was slaughtered and then eaten. al-manna was a sweet substance which
~~appeared on the trees or stones. it was sweet like honey and after
~~drying, it took the form of gum. according to others, it was honey or
~~sweet water (tafsir ahsan-ul-bayan). the truffle is similar to al-manna.
~~this means that as banu israel were given food without toil, so we find
~~truffle in nature without effort. the juice of truffle is useful in
~~curing some diseases of the eye. this prescription was suggested by the
~~prophet (pbuh). it is surely beneficial. PageV01P2436

~~heart, and i supplicate allah for forgiveness a hundred times in a

~~signify the spreading of the clouds. it refers in this hadith to the
~~fact that the prophet (pbuh) was reciting the names of allah and
~~remembering him all the time. but sometimes due to being too busy in the
~~affairs of the public or due to human needs, there was a pause in this
~~eternal remembrance. although such a pause was only momentary, this
~~momentary pause was very much disliked by him; and considering it a
~~slackness on his part, he prayed for forgiveness from allah. in this
~~there is an important lesson for us. in spite of our many sins and
~~negligence on our part, we do not turn to allah and seek forgiveness;
~~while, although our prophet (pbuh) had all his past and future sins
~~forgiven by allah, he sought forgiveness very often. PageV01P2440

~~allah will certainly forgive them.'' [muslim]. commentary: this hadith
~~does not mean that allah likes disobedience. but by this way of
~~description, the aim is to emphasize the importance of seeking
~~forgiveness from allah. we know that every man commits sins. but allah
~~likes those people who, after committing a sin, do not stick to it, but
~~right away seek forgiveness for their sins from allah. they weep and
~~express sorrow before allah. by seeking forgiveness, a relationship with

~~مسلم 1879. ibn `umar (may allah be pleased with them) said: the prophet

~~seeking allah's forgiveness because i have seen (i.e., on the night of
~~the ascension to the highest heavens) that dwellers of the hell are
~~women.'' a woman amongst them said: "why is it that the majority of the
~~dwellers of hell are women?'' the prophet (pbuh) replied, "you curse
~~frequently and are ungrateful to your husbands. in spite of your lacking
~~in wisdom and failing in religion, you are depriving the wisest of men
~~of their intelligence.'' upon this the woman asked: "what is the
~~deficiency in our wisdom and in our religion?'' he (pbuh) replied, "your
~~lack of wisdom can be well judged from the fact that the evidence of two
~~women is equal to that one man. you do not offer salat (prayer) for some
~~days and you do not fast (the whole of) ramadan sometimes, it is a
~~deficiency in religion.'' [muslim]. commentary: 1. in this narration,
~~certain weaknesses of the female sex have been pointed out, which are
~~natural and pertain to the woman's biology, psychology and embryology.
~~according to biologists, during and before menstruation, a female's
~~thought process is affected. similarly, her pulse and blood pressure are
~~also altered. females are also more prone to hysteria. for these
~~reasons, the qur'an has declared that when you have to appoint or choose
~~witnesses among women, you should choose two in place of one man. modern
~~researches have proved this rule to be correct on the basis of biology,
~~psychology and embryology. again we know that physically speaking, the
~~female has been named as the weaker sex. for these reasons, females have
~~been excused from earning their livelihood. for earning livelihood, one
~~may have to go out and work hard. women have been exempted from this
~~duty because of their biological differences and other considerations of
~~shari`ah. present-day women who are ignorant of islam and modern
~~researches are not prepared to accept these scientifically and
~~religiously proved facts. the west claims equality between the sexes.
~~but this equality has not been established so far. today all the
~~important posts are occupied by males and all the international policies
~~are framed by them alone. even matters pertaining to women are decided
~~by them. they have mostly relegated them to the posts of workers,
~~secretaries and stenographers for their sexual satisfaction and
~~enjoyment. after a struggle for hundred years, their condition today
~~proves that they are the weaker sex. so, it is both beneficial and more
~~respectful for her to limit herself to the sphere of action suggested
~~for her by islam. if she oversteps her sphere, she will certainly lose
~~her female dignity and prestige, as has happened in the west. her state
~~and condition there is an eyeopener for all. 2. women should request
~~forgiveness from allah very often and be generous in charity. they
~~should not show ungratefulness to their husbands and should avoid
~~backbiting and cursing others so that they may save themselves from
~~hell. PageV01P2450

~~breasts any deep feeling of bitterness (that they may have). (so they
~~will be like) brothers facing each other on thrones. no sense of fatigue
~~shall touch them, nor shall they (ever) be asked to leave it.''

~~`my slaves! no fear shall be on you this day, nor shall you grieve.
~~(you) who believed in our ayat (proofs, verses, lessons, signs,
~~revelations, etc.) and were muslims (i.e., who submit totally to allah's
~~will, and believe in the oneness of allah). enter jannah, you and your
~~wives, in happiness.' trays of gold and cups will be passed round them;
~~(there will be) therein all that inner-selves could desire, and all that
~~eyes could delight in and you will abide therein forever. this is the
~~jannah which you have been made to inherit because of your deeds which
~~you used to do (in the life of the world). therein for you will be
~~fruits in plenty, of which you will eat (as you desire).'' (43:68-73)
~~"verily, the muttaqun (the pious), will be in place of security
~~(jannah). among gardens and springs. dressed in fine silk and (also) in
~~thick silk, facing each other. so (it will be). and we shall marry them

~~therein except the first death (of this world), and he will save them

~~they will be given to drink of pure sealed wine. the last thereof (that
~~wine) will be the smell of musk, and for this let (all) those strive who
~~want to strive (i.e., hasten earnestly to the obedience of allah). it

~~ذاك جشاء كرشح المسك يلهمون التسبيح والتكبير كما يلهمون النفس ] رواه مسلم
~~1880. jabir (may allah be pleased with him) reported: the messenger of
~~allah (pbuh) said, "the inhabitants of jannah will eat and drink
~~therein, but they will not have to pass excrement, to blow their noses
~~or to urinate. their food will be digested producing belch which will
~~give out a smell like that of musk. they will be inspired to declare the
~~freedom of allah from imperfection and proclaim his greatness as easily
~~as you breathe.'' [muslim]. commentary: belching the vapours of musk
~~means that after meals one would not feel heaviness and acidity. on the
~~other hand, the belch will give out scented air, and the food will be
~~digested by it. there will be no excrement or urine there. secondly,
~~recitation of allah's name will ever remain on their tongues without the
~~least effort like the way we breathe, without any effort whatsoever. in
~~other words the food in jannah would be so light and fine that there
~~would be no disagreeable urine excrement. on the other hand, there will

~~(may allah be pleased with him) said: the messenger of allah (pbuh)
~~said, "the first group (of people) to enter jannah will be shining like
~~the moon on a full-moon night. then will come those who follow them who
~~will be like the most shining planet in the sky. they will not stand in
~~need of urinating or relieving of nature or of spitting or blowing their
~~noses. their combs will be of gold and their sweat will smell like musk;
~~in their censers the aloes-wood will be used. their wives will be large
~~eyed maidens. all men will be alike in the form of their father `adam,
~~sixty cubits tall.'' another narration is: the messenger of allah (pbuh)
~~said, "their utensils will be of gold, their perspiration will smell
~~like musk; everyone of them will have two wives; the marrow of the bones
~~of the wives' legs will be seen through the flesh out of excessive
~~beauty. they (i.e., the people of jannah) will neither have difference,
~~nor enmity (hatred) amongst themselves; their hearts will be as if one
~~heart, and they will be glorifying allah in the morning and in the
~~afternoon.'' [al-bukhari and muslim]. commentary: 1. the people in the
~~jannah would be similar in shape and height, etc. there would be no
~~differences between them. it won't be that one person is beautiful and
~~the other ugly or one is fair in colour and the other is black. this is
~~one view. the other view is that they would be similar in being good
~~mannered and the desirable and loving disposition. they will be on the
~~highest pedestal of ethics, etiquette, politeness and morality. none of
~~them would be immoral, discourteous or ill-tempered. 2. everyone there
~~would have two wives. they would either be from the houris or from the
~~humans. the narration, which claims that every one would have seventy-
~~two wives has a weak chain of narrators. however, in one narration of
~~at-tirmidhi which has been claimed to be sahih, it is stated that a
~~martyr would get seventy-two wives. (at-tirmidhi, chapter about the
~~superiority of jihad). then the saying, "one would get in the jannah
~~what he wants'' may also be considered and so the possibility of more
~~than two wives cannot be denied. 3. hur is the plural of howra it means
~~white and pink. so it is said that one would be bewildered to see their
~~beauty. `ein is the plural of `aina' it means one having large eyes like
~~a deer. in another narration it is said that if any one of them just
~~peeps towards our earth, the whole space would be filled with scent and
~~all the space would be lighted. her sheet of cloth used to cover the
~~head and the bosom would be so precious that its cost would exceed this
~~whole material earth. (sahih al-bukhari, book of jihad, chapter about

~~سبحانك اللهم وتحيتهم فيها سلام وآخر دعواهم أن الحمد لله رب العالمين }
~~allah, the exalted, says: "verily, those who believe and do deeds of
~~righteousness, their rubb will guide them through their faith; under
~~them will flow rivers in the gardens of delight (jannah). their way of
~~request therein will be subhanaka allahumma (glory to you, o allah!) and
~~salam (peace, safety from evil) will be their greetings therein
~~(jannah)! and the close of their request will be: al-hamdu lillahi
~~rabbil-`alamin [all the praises and thanks are to allah, the rubb of
~~`alamin (mankind, jinn and all that exists)].'' (10:9,10) PageV01P2470
